<h4>PREFACE</h4>

<p>In this book I have sketched the principles of the mental life of
groups and have made a rough attempt to apply these principles
to the understanding of the life of nations. I have had the substance
of the book in the form of lecture notes for some years, but have
long hesitated to publish it. I have been held back, partly by my
sense of the magnitude and difficulty of the subject and the inadequacy
of my own preparation for dealing with it, partly because
I wished to build upon a firm foundation of generally accepted
principles of human nature.</p>

<p>Some fifteen years ago I projected a complete treatise on Social
Psychology which would have comprised the substance of the present
volume. I was prevented from carrying out the ambitious scheme,
partly by the difficulty of finding a publisher, partly by my increasing
sense of the lack of any generally accepted or acceptable account of
the constitution of human nature. I found it necessary to attempt
to provide such a foundation, and in 1908 published my <i>Introduction
to Social Psychology</i>. That book has enjoyed a certain popular
success. But it was more novel, more revolutionary, than I had
supposed when writing it; and my hope that it would rapidly be
accepted by my colleagues as in the main a true account of the
fundamentals of human nature has not been realised.</p>

<p>All this part of psychology labours under the great difficulty that
the worker in it cannot, like other men of science, publish his conclusions
as discoveries which will necessarily be accepted by any
persons competent to judge. He can only state his conclusions and
his reasonings and hope that they may gradually gain the general
approval of his colleagues. For to the obscure questions of fact with
which he deals it is in the nature of things impossible to return
answers supported by indisputable experimental proofs. In this
field the evidence of an author&#8217;s approximation towards truth can
consist only in his success in gradually persuading competent opinion
of the value of his views. My sketch of the fundamentals of human
nature can hardly claim even that degree of success which would be
constituted by an active criticism and discussion of it in competent
quarters. Yet there are not wanting indications that opinion is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
turning slowly towards the acceptance of some such doctrine as I
then outlined. Especially the development of psycho-pathology,
stimulated so greatly by the esoteric dogmas of the Freudian school,
points in this direction. The only test and verification to which any
scheme of human nature can be submitted is the application of it
to practice in the elucidation of the concrete phenomena of human
life and in the control and direction of conduct, especially in the two
great fields of medicine and education. And I have been much
encouraged by finding that some workers in both of these fields have
found my scheme of use in their practice and have even, in some
few cases, given it a cordial general approval. But group psychology
is itself one of the fields in which such testing and verification must
be sought. And I have decided to delay no longer in attempting
to bring my scheme to this test. I am also impelled to venture
on what may appear to be premature publication by the fact that
five of the best years of my life have been wholly given up to military
service and the practical problems of psycho-therapy, and by the
reflection that the years of a man&#8217;s life are numbered and that, even
though I should delay yet another fifteen years, I might find that I
had made but little progress towards securing the firm foundation
I desired.</p>

<p>It may seem to some minds astonishing that I should now admit
that the substance of this book was committed to writing before
the Great War; for that war is supposed by some to have revolutionised
all our ideas of human nature and of national life. But the
war has given me little reason to add to or to change what I had
written. This may be either because I am too old to learn, or
because what I had written was in the main true; and I am naturally
disposed to accept the second explanation.</p>

<p>I wish to make it clear to any would-be reader of this volume
that it is a sequel to my <i>Introduction to Social Psychology</i>, that it
builds upon that book and assumes that the reader is acquainted
with it. That former volume has been criticised as an attempted
outline of <i>Social Psychology</i>. One critic remarks that it may be good
psychology, but it is very little social; another wittily says &#8220;Mr
McDougall, while giving a full account of the genesis of instincts
that act in society, hardly shows how they issue into society. He
seems to do a great deal of packing in preparation for a journey on
which he never starts.&#8221; The last sentence exactly describes the
book. I found myself, like so many of my predecessors and contemporaries,
about to start on a voyage of exploration of societies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
with an empty trunk, or at least with one very inadequately supplied
with the things essential for successful travelling. I decided to avoid
the usual practice of starting without impedimenta and of picking
up or inventing bits of make-shift equipment as each emergency
arose; I would pack my trunk carefully before starting. And now
although my fellow travellers have not entirely approved my outfit,
I have launched out to put it to the test; and I cannot hope that
my readers will follow me if they have not at their command a
similar outfit&mdash;namely, a similar view of the constitution of human
nature.</p>

<p>I would gratefully confess that the resolve to go forward without
a further long period of preparation has been made possible for me
largely by the encouragement I have had from the recently published
work of Dr James Drever, <i>Instinct in Man</i>. For the author of that
work has carefully studied the most fundamental part of my <i>Social
Psychology</i>, in the light of his wide knowledge of the cognate literature,
and has found it to be in the main acceptable.</p>

<p>The title and much of the substance of the present volume might
lead a hasty reader to suppose that I am influenced by, or even in
sympathy with, the political philosophy associated with German
&#8216;idealism.&#8217; I would, therefore, take this opportunity both to prevent
any such erroneous inference and to indicate my attitude towards
that system of thought in plainer language than it seemed possible to
use before the war. I have argued that we may properly speak of
a group mind, and that each of the most developed nations of the
present time may be regarded as in process of developing a group
mind. This must lay me open to the suspicion of favouring the
political philosophy which makes of the state a super-individual and
semi-divine person before whom all men must bow down, renouncing
their claims to freedom of judgment and action; the political philosophy
in short of German &#8216;idealism,&#8217; which derives in the main
from Hegel, which has been so ably represented in this country by
Dr Bosanquet, which has exerted so great an influence at Oxford,
and which in my opinion is as detrimental to honest and clear
thinking as it has proved to be destructive of political morality in
its native country. I am relieved of the necessity of attempting to
justify these severe strictures by the recent publication of <i>The
Metaphysical Theory of the State</i> by Prof. L. T. Hobhouse. In that
volume Prof. Hobhouse has subjected the political philosophy of
German &#8216;idealism,&#8217; and especially Dr Bosanquet&#8217;s presentation of it,
to a criticism which, as it seems to me, should suffice to expose the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
hollowness of its claims to all men for all time; and I cannot better
define my own attitude towards it than by expressing the completeness
of my sympathy with the searching criticism of Mr Hobhouse&#8217;s
essay. In my youth I was misled into supposing that the Germans
were the possessors of a peculiar wisdom; and I have spent a large
part of my life in discovering, in one field of science after another,
that I was mistaken. I can always read the works of some German
philosophers, especially those of Hermann Lotze, with admiration
and profit; but I have no longer any desire to contend with the great
systems of &#8216;idealism,&#8217; and I think it a cruel waste that the best
years of the lives of many young men should be spent struggling
with the obscure phrases in which Kant sought to express his profound
and subtle thought. My first scientific effort was to find
evidence in support of a new hypothesis of muscular contraction;
and, in working through the various German theories, I was dismayed
by their lack of clear mechanical conceptions. My next
venture was in the physiology of vision, a branch of science which
had become almost exclusively German. Starting with a prepossession
in favour of one of the dominant German theories, I soon
reached the conclusion that the two German leaders in this field,
Helmholtz and Hering, with their hosts of disciples, had, in spite
of much admirable detailed work, added little of value and much
confusion to the theory of vision left us by a great Englishman,&mdash;namely,
Thomas Young; and in a long series of papers I endeavoured
to restate and supplement Young&#8217;s theory. Advancing into the field
of physiological psychology, I attacked the ponderous volumes of
Wundt with enthusiasm; only to find that his physiology of the
nervous system was a tissue of unacceptable hypotheses and that
he failed to connect it in any profitable manner with his questionable
psychology. And, finding even less satisfaction in such works
as Ziehen&#8217;s <i>Physiologische Psychologie</i>, with its crude materialism
and associationism, or in the dogmatic speculations of Verworn, I
published my own small attempt to bring psychology into fruitful
relations with the physiology of the nervous system. This brought
me up against the great problem of the relations between mind and
body; and, having found that, in this sphere, German &#8216;idealism&#8217; was
pragmatically indistinguishable from thorough-going materialism,
and that those Germans who claimed to reconcile the two did not
really rise much above the level of Ernst Haeckel&#8217;s wild flounderings,
I published my <i>History and Defense of Animism</i>. And in this field,
though I found much to admire in the writings of Lotze, I derived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
most encouragement and stimulus from Prof. Bergson. In working
at the foundations of human nature, I found little help in German
psychology, and more in French books, especially in those of Prof.
Ribot. In psycho-pathology I seemed to find that the claims of
the German and Austrian schools were far outweighed by those of
the French writers, especially of Prof. Janet. So now, in attacking
the problems of the mental life of societies, I have found little help
from German psychology or sociology, from the elaborations of
Wundt&#8217;s <i>V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</i> or the ponderosities of Sch&auml;ffle, and still
less from the &#8216;idealist&#8217; philosophy of politics. In this field also it
is French authors from whom I have learnt most and with whom
I find myself most in sympathy, especially MM. Fouill&eacute;e, Boutmy,
Tarde, and Demolins; though I would not be thought to hold in
low esteem the works of many English and American authors,
notably those of Buckle, Bagehot, Maine, Lecky, Lowell, and of
many others, to some of which I have made reference in the chapters
of this book.</p>

<p>I have striven to make this a strictly scientific work, rather than
a philosophical one; that is to say, I have tried to ascertain and state
the facts and principles of social life as it is and has been, without
expressing my opinion as to what it should be. But, in order further
to guard myself against the implications attached by German
&#8216;idealism&#8217; to the notion of a collective mind, I wish to state that
politically my sympathies are with individualism and internationalism,
although I have, I think, fully recognised the great and necessary
part played in human life by the Group Spirit and by that special
form of it which we now call &#8216;Nationalism.&#8217;</p>

<p>I know well that those of my readers whose sympathies are
with Collectivism, Syndicalism, or Socialism in any of its various
forms will detect in this book the cloven foot of individualism and
leanings towards the aristocratic principle. I know also that many
others will reproach me with giving countenance to communistic
and ultra-democratic tendencies. I would, therefore, point out
explicitly at the outset that, if this book affords justification for any
normative doctrine or ideal, it is for one which would aim at a synthesis
of the principles of individualism and communism, of aristocracy
and democracy, of self-realization and of service to the
community. I can best express this ideal in the wise words of
Mr F. H. Bradley, which I extract from his famous essay on &#8216;My
Station and its Duties.&#8217; &#8220;The individual&#8217;s consciousness of himself
is inseparable from the knowing himself as an organ of the whole;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
... for his nature now is not distinct from his &#8216;artificial self.&#8217; He
is related to the living moral system not as to a foreign body; his
relation to it is &#8216;too inward even for faith,&#8217; since faith implies a
certain separation. It is no other-world that he can not see but
must trust to; he feels himself in it, and it in him; ... the belief in
this real moral organism is the one solution of ethical problems. It
breaks down the antithesis of despotism and individualism; it denies
them, while it preserves the truth of both. The truth of individualism
is saved, because, unless we have intense life and self-consciousness
in the members of the state, the whole state is ossified. The truth of
despotism is saved, because, unless the member realizes the whole
by and in himself, he fails to reach his own individuality. Considered
in the main, the best communities are those which have the
best men for their members, and the best men are the members of
the best communities.... The two problems of the best man and
best state are two sides, two distinguishable aspects of the one
problem, how to realize in human nature the perfect unity of homogeneity
and specification; and when we see that each of these
without the other is unreal, then we see that (speaking in general)
the welfare of the state and the welfare of its individuals are questions
which it is mistaken and ruinous to separate. Personal morality
and political and social institutions can not exist apart, and (in
general) the better the one the better the other. The community is
moral, because it realizes personal morality; personal morality is
moral, because and in so far as it realizes the moral whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since correcting the proofs of this volume I have become acquainted
with two recent books whose teaching is so closely in
harmony with my own that I wish to direct my readers&#8217; attention
to them. One is Sir Martin Conway&#8217;s <i>The Crowd in Peace and War</i>,
which contains many valuable illustrations of group life. The other
is Miss M. P. Follett&#8217;s <i>The New State; Group Organization the Solution
of Popular Government</i>, which expounds the principles and advantages
of collective deliberation with vigour and insight.</p>

<p>I am under much obligation to the general editor of this series,
Prof. G. Dawes Hicks. He has read the proofs of my book, and has
helped me greatly with many suggestions; but he has, of course, no
responsibility for the views expressed in it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Province of Collective Psychology</span></h4>

<p>To define exactly the relations of the several special sciences is a
task which can never be completely achieved so long as these sciences
continue to grow and change. It is a peculiarly difficult task in
respect of the biological sciences, because we have not yet reached
general agreement as to the fundamental conceptions which these
sciences should employ. To illustrate this difficulty I need only
refer to a recent symposium of the Aristotelian Society in which a
number of distinguished philosophers and biologists discussed the
question &#8220;Are physical, biological and psychological categories irreducible?&#8221;
The discussion revealed extreme differences of opinion,
and failed to bring the disputants nearer to a common view. The
difficulty is still greater in respect of the human sciences&mdash;anthropology,
psychology, ethics, politics, economics, sociology, and the
rest; and it is not to be hoped that any general agreement on this
difficult question will be reached in the near future. Yet it seems
worth while that each writer who aspires to break new ground in
any part of this field of inquiry should endeavour to make clear to
himself and others his conception of the relations of that part to the
rest of the field. It is, then, in no dogmatic spirit, or with any belief in
the finality of the position assigned to my topic, that I venture the
following definition of the province of psychology with which this
book is concerned.</p>

<p>I have chosen the title, &#8220;The Group Mind,&#8221; after some hesitation
in favour of the alternative, &#8220;Collective Psychology.&#8221; The latter has
the advantage that it has already been used by several continental
authors, more especially French and Italian psychologists. But the
title I have chosen is, I think, more distinctively English in quality
and denotes more clearly the topic that I desire to discuss.</p>

<p>An alternative and not inappropriate title would have been &#8220;An
Outline of Social Psychology&#8221;; but two reasons prevented the
adoption of this. First, my <i>Introduction to Social Psychology</i> has
become generally known by the abbreviated title <i>Social Psychology</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
This was an unforeseen result and unfortunate designation; for, as I
have explained in the Preface to the present volume, that other work
was designed merely as a propaedeutic; it aimed merely at clearing
the ground and laying the foundations for Social Psychology, while
leaving the topic itself for subsequent treatment. Secondly, I conceive
Group Psychology to be a part only, though a very large part,
of the total field of Social Psychology; for, while the former has to
deal only with the life of groups, the latter has also to describe and
account for the influence of the group on the growth and activities
of the individual. This is the most concrete part of psychology and
naturally comes last in the order of development of the science;
for, like other sciences, psychology began with the most abstract
notions, the forms of activity of mind in general, and, by the aid of
the abstract conceptions achieved by the earlier workers, progresses
to the consideration of more concrete problems, the problems presented
by actual living persons in all their inexhaustible richness
and complexity.</p>

<p>Until the later decades of the nineteenth century, psychology
continued to concern itself almost exclusively with the mind of
man conceived in an abstract fashion, not as the mind of any
particular individual, but as the mind of a representative individual
considered in abstraction from his social settings as something given
to our contemplation fully formed and complete.</p>

<p>Two important changes of modern thought have shown the necessity
of a more concrete treatment of psychological problems. The
first has been the coming into prominence of the problems of genesis
which, although not originated by Darwin, received so great an impetus
from his work. The second has been the increasing realisation of the
need for a more synthetic treatment of all fields of science, the realisation
that analysis alone carries us ever farther away from concrete
problems and leads only to a system of abstract conceptions which
are very remote from reality, however useful they may prove in the
physical sciences. The biological and the human sciences especially
have been profoundly affected by these two changes of modern
thought. As Theodore Merz has so well shown in the fourth volume
of his monumental work<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, the need has been increasingly felt of the
<i>vue d&#8217;ensemble</i>, of the synthetic mode of regarding organisms, men,
and institutions, not as single things, self-contained and complete in
themselves, but as merely nodes or meeting points of all the forces
of the world acting and reacting in unlimited time and space.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychology was, then, until recent years the science of the
abstract individual mind. Each worker aimed at rendering by the
aid of introspection an analytic description of the stream of his own
consciousness, a consistent classification of the elements or features
that he seemed to discover therein, and some general laws or rules
of the order of succession and conjunction of these features; postulating
in addition some one or more explanatory principles or active
agencies such as &#8216;the will&#8217; or the desire of pleasure, the aversion
from pain, or &#8216;the association of ideas,&#8217; to enable him to account
for the flow of the distinguishable elements of consciousness. The
psychology achieved by these studies, necessary and valuable as
they were, was of little help to men who were struggling with the
concrete problems of human life and was therefore largely ignored
by them. But, as I have pointed out in the Introduction to my
<i>Social Psychology</i>, those who approached these problems were
generally stimulated to do so by their interest in questions of right
and wrong, in questions of norms and standards of conduct, the
urgency of which demanded immediate answers for the practical
guidance of human life in all its spheres of activity, for the shaping
of laws, institutions, governments, and associations of every kind;
or, as frequently perhaps, for the justification and defence of standards
of conduct, modes of belief, and forms of institution, which
men had learnt to esteem as supremely good.</p>

<p>Thus the political science of Hobbes was the expression of his
attempt to justify the monarchy established by the Tudors and endangered
by the failings of the Stuart kings; while that of Locke
was equally the outcome of his desire to justify the revolution of
1668. Hobbes felt it worth while to preface his <i>magnum opus</i>
on political philosophy with a fanciful sketch of human nature and
of primitive society; yet, as Mr Gooch remarks, &#8220;neither Hobbes
nor his contemporaries knew anything of the actual life of primitive
communities<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.&#8221; And it may be added that they knew as little of
the foundations of human nature. Again, the social doctrines of
Rousseau, with all their false psychology, were formulated in order
to stir men to revolt against the conditions of social life then prevalent
in Europe. In a similar way, in the development of all that
body of social doctrine that went under the name of Utilitarianism
and which culminated in the political science and economy of the
Manchester School, every step was prompted by the desire to find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>theoretical guidance or justification for rules governing human
activity. And, if we go back to the <i>Politics</i> of Aristotle, we find the
normative or regulative aim still more prominent.</p>

<p>Thus, in all the human sciences, we see that the search for what
is has been inextricably confused with and hampered by the effort
to show what ought to be; and the further back we go in their
history, the more does the normative point of view predominate.
They all begin in the effort to describe what ought to be; and
incidentally give some more or less fallacious or fantastic account
of what is, merely in order to support the normative doctrines. And,
as we trace their history forward towards the present time, we find
the positive element coming more and more to the front, until it
tends to preponderate over and even completely to supplant the
normative aim. Thus even in Ethics there is now perceptible in
some quarters a tendency to repudiate the normative standpoint.
All the social sciences have, then, begun their work at what, from
the strictly logical point of view, was the wrong end; instead of first
securing a basis of positive science and then building up the normative
doctrines upon that basis, they have advanced by repeatedly
going backwards towards what should have been their foundations.
Now the most important part of the positive basis of the social
sciences is psychology; we find accordingly the social sciences at
first ignoring psychology and then gradually working back to it;
they became gradually more psychological and, in proportion as
they did so, they became more valuable. Modern writers on these
topics fall into two classes; those who have attempted to work upon
a psychological foundation, and those who have ignored or denied
the need of any such basis. The earlier efforts of the former kind,
among which we may reckon those of Adam Smith, Bentham, and
the Mills, although they greatly influenced legislation and practice
in general, have nevertheless brought the psychological method into
some disrepute, because they reasoned from psychological principles
which were unduly simplified and in fact misleading, notably the
famous principle of psychological hedonism on which they so greatly
relied. Their psychology was, in brief, too abstract; it had not
achieved the necessary concreteness, which only the introduction of
the genetic standpoint and the <i>vue d&#8217;ensemble</i> could give it. Other
writers on the social sciences were content to ignore the achievements
of psychology; but, since they dealt with the activities of human
beings and the products of those activities, such as laws, institutions
and customs, they could hardly avoid all reference to the human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
mind and its processes; they then relied upon the crude unanalysed
psychological conceptions of popular speech; often they went further
and, aspiring to explain the phenomena they described, made vast
assumptions about the constitution and working of the human mind.
Thus, for example, Renan, when he sought to explain some feature
of the history of a nation or society, was in the habit, like many
others, of ascribing it to some peculiar instinct which he postulated
for this particular purpose, such as a political or a religious instinct
or an instinct of subordination or of organisation. Comte made
egoism and altruism the two master forces of the mind. Sir Henry
Maine asserted that &#8220;satisfaction and impatience are the two great
sources of political conduct,&#8221; and, after asserting that &#8220;no force
acting on mankind has been less carefully examined than Party, and
yet none better deserves examination,&#8221; he was content to conclude
that &#8220;Party is probably nothing more than a survival and a consequence
of the primitive combativeness of mankind<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.&#8221; More recently
Prof. Giddings has discovered the principal force underlying all
human associations in <i>Consciousness of Kind</i>. Butler and the
intuitive moralists postulated &#8216;conscience&#8217; or moral sense as
something innately present in the souls of men; while the creators
of the classical school of political economy were for the most part
content to assume that man is a purely rational being who always
intelligently pursues his own best interest, a false premise from
which they deduced some conclusions that have not withstood the
test of time. Similar vague assumptions may be found in almost
every work on the social sciences,&mdash;all illustrating the need for a
psychology more concrete than the older individual psychology, as
a basis for these sciences, a positive science, not of some hypothetical
Robinson Crusoe, but of the mental life of men as it
actually unfolds itself in the families, tribes, nations, societies of all
sorts, that make up the human world.</p>

<p>The general growth of interest in genetic problems, stimulated
so greatly by the work of Darwin, turned the attention of psychologists
to the problem of the genesis of the developed human mind,&mdash;the
problem of its evolution in the race and its development in the
individual. Then it at once became apparent that both these processes
are essentially social; that they involve, and at every step are
determined by, interactions between the individual and his social
environment; that, while the growth of the individual mind is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
moulded by the mental forces of the society in which it grows up,
those forces are in turn the products of the interplay of the minds
composing the society; that, therefore, we can only understand the
life of individuals and the life of societies, if we consider them
always in relation to one another. It was realised that each man is
an individual only in an incomplete sense; that he is but a unit in
a vast system of vital and spiritual forces which, expressing themselves
in the form of human societies, are working towards ends which
no man can foresee; a unit whose chief function it is to transmit
these forces unimpaired, which can change or add to them only in
infinitesimal degree, and which, therefore, has but little significance
and cannot be accounted for when considered in abstraction from
that system. It became clear that the play of this system of forces
at any moment of history is predominantly determined by conditions
which are themselves the products of an immensely long course of
evolution, conditions which have been produced by the mental
activities of countless generations and which are but very little
modified by the members of society living at any one time; so that,
as has been said, society consists of the dead as well as of the living,
and the part of the living in determining its life is but insignificant
as compared with the part of the dead.</p>

<p>Any psychology that recognises these facts and attempts to
display the reciprocal influences of the individual and the society
in which he plays his part may be called Social Psychology. Collective
or Group Psychology is, then, a part of this larger field. It has to
study the mental life of societies of all kinds; and such understanding
of the group life as it can achieve has then to be used by Social
Psychology in rendering more concrete and complete our understanding
of the individual life.</p>

<p>Group Psychology itself consists properly of two parts, that
which is concerned to discover the most general principles of group
life, and that which applies these principles to the study of particular
kinds and examples of group life. The former is logically prior to
the second; though in practice it is hardly possible to keep them
wholly apart. The present volume is concerned chiefly with the
former branch. Only when the general principles of group life
have been applied to the understanding of particular societies, of
nations and the manifold system of groups within the nation, will
it be possible for Social Psychology to return upon the individual
life and give of it an adequate account in all its concrete fulness.</p>

<p>The nature of Group Psychology may be illustrated by reference
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to Herbert Spencer&#8217;s conception of sociology. Spencer pointed out
that, if you set out to build a stable pile of solid bodies of a certain
shape, the kind of structure resulting is determined by the shapes
and properties of these units, that for example, if the units are
spheres, there are only very few stable forms which the pile can
assume. The same is true, he said, of such physical processes as
crystallisation; the form and properties of the whole or aggregate
are determined by the properties of the units. He maintained with
less plausibility that the same holds good of animal and vegetable
forms and of the elements of which they are composed. And he went
on to argue that, in like manner, the structure and properties of
a society are determined by the properties of the units, the individual
human beings, of which it is composed.</p>

<p>This last proposition is true in a very partial sense only. For
the aggregate which is a society has, in virtue of its past history,
positive qualities which it does not derive from the units which
compose it at any one time; and in virtue of these qualities it acts
upon its units in a manner very different from that in which the
units as such interact with one another. Further, each unit, when it
becomes a member of a group, displays properties or modes of
reaction which it does not display, which remain latent or potential
only, so long as it remains outside that group. It is possible,
therefore, to discover these potentialities of the units only by
studying them as elements in the life of the whole. That is to
say, the aggregate which is a society has a certain individuality,
is a true whole which in great measure determines the nature and
the modes of activity of its parts; it is an organic whole. The society
has a mental life which is not the mere sum of the mental lives of
its units existing as independent units; and a complete knowledge
of the units, if and in so far as they could be known as isolated units,
would not enable us to deduce the nature of the life of the whole,
in the way that is implied by Spencer&#8217;s analogies.</p>

<p>Since, then, the social aggregate has a collective mental life,
which is not merely the sum of the mental lives of its units, it may
be contended that a society not only enjoys a collective mental
life but also has a collective mind or, as some prefer to say, a
collective soul.</p>

<p>The tasks of Group Psychology are, then, to examine the conception
of the collective or group mind, in order to determine whether
and in what sense this is a valid conception; to display the general
principles of collective mental life which are incapable of being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
deduced from the laws of the mental life of isolated individuals;
to distinguish the principal types of collective mental life or group
mind; to describe the peculiarities of those types and as far as
possible to account for them. More shortly, Group Psychology has,
first, to establish the general principles of group life (this is general
collective psychology); secondly, it has to apply these principles in
the endeavour to understand particular examples of group life.
Group Psychology, thus conceived, meets at the outset a difficulty
which stands in the way of every attempt of psychology to
leave the narrow field of highly abstract individual psychology. It
finds the ground already staked out and occupied by the representatives
of another science, who are inclined to resent its intrusion
as an encroachment on their rights. The science which claims to
have occupied the field of Group Psychology is Sociology; and it is
of some importance that the claims of these sciences should be
reconciled, so that they may live and work harmoniously together.
I have no desire to claim for Group Psychology the whole province
of Sociology. As I conceive it, that province is much wider than
that of Group Psychology. Sociology is essentially a science which
has to take a comprehensive and synthetic view of the life of mankind,
and has to accept and make use of the conclusions of many
other more special sciences, of which psychology, and especially
Group Psychology, is for it perhaps the most important. But other
special sciences have very important if less intimate contributions
to make to it. Thus, if it be true that great civilisations have decayed
owing to changes of climate of their habitats, or owing to the introduction
of such diseases as malaria into them, then Climatology and
Epidemiology have their contributions to make to Sociology. If
peculiarities of diet or the crossing of racial stocks may profoundly
affect the vigour of peoples, Physiology must have its say. General
biology and the science of Genetics are bringing to light much that
must be incorporated in Sociology. Economics, although needing
to be treated far more psychologically than it commonly has been,
has its special contribution to make. These are only a few illustrations
of the fact that the field of Sociology is very much wider and
more general than that of Group Psychology, however important to
it the conclusions of the narrower science may be.</p>

<p>In this book it will be maintained that the conception of a group
mind is useful and therefore valid; and, since this notion has already
excited some opposition and criticism and is one that requires very
careful definition, some attempt to define and justify it may usefully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
be made at the outset; though the completer justification is the
substance of the whole book. Some writers have assumed the reality
of what is called the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of a society, meaning
thereby a unitary consciousness of the society over and above that of
the individuals comprised within it. This conception is examined in
Chapter II and provisionally rejected. But it is maintained that a
society, when it enjoys a long life and becomes highly organised,
acquires a structure and qualities which are largely independent of
the qualities of the individuals who enter into its composition and
take part for a brief time in its life. It becomes an organised system
of forces which has a life of its own, tendencies of its own, a power
of moulding all its component individuals, and a power of perpetuating
itself as a self-identical system, subject only to slow and
gradual change.</p>

<p>In an earlier work, in which I have sketched in outline the program
of psychology<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, I wrote: &#8220;When the student of behaviour
has learnt from the various departments of psychology ... all that
they can teach him of the structure, genesis, and modes of operation
of the individual mind, a large field still awaits his exploration. If
we put aside as unproven such speculations as that touched on at
the end of the foregoing chapter (the view of James that the human
mind can enter into an actual union or communion with the divine
mind) and refuse to admit any modes of communication or influence
between minds other than through the normal channels of sense-perception
and bodily movement, we must nevertheless recognise
the existence in a certain sense of over-individual or collective minds.
We may fairly define a mind as an organised system of mental or
purposive forces; and, in the sense so defined, every highly organised
human society may properly be said to possess a collective mind.
For the collective actions which constitute the history of any such
society are conditioned by an organisation which can only be
described in terms of mind, and which yet is not comprised within
the mind of any individual; the society is rather constituted by the
system of relations obtaining between the individual minds which
are its units of composition. Under any given circumstances the
actions of the society are, or may be, very different from the mere
sum of the actions with which its several members would react
to the situation in the absence of the system of relations which
render them a society; or, in other words, the thinking and acting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of each man, in so far as he thinks and acts as a member of a
society, are very different from his thinking and acting as an isolated
individual.&#8221;</p>

<p>This passage has been cited by the author of a notable work on
Sociology<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, and made by him the text of a polemic against the conception
of the group mind. He writes: &#8220;This passage contains two
arguments in favour of the hypothesis of super-individual &#8216;collective&#8217;
minds, neither of which can stand examination. The &#8216;definition&#8217; of
a mind as &#8216;an organised system of mental or purposive forces&#8217; is
totally inadequate. When we speak of the mind of an individual we
mean something more than this. The mind of each of us has a unity
other than that of such a system.&#8221; But I doubt whether Mr Maciver
could explain exactly what kind of unity it is that he postulates.
Is it the unity of soul substance? I have myself contended at some
length that this is a necessary postulate or hypothesis<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, but I do not
suppose that Maciver accepts or intends to refer to this conception.
Is it the unity of consciousness or of self-consciousness? Then the
answer is that this unity is by no means a general and established
function of the individual mind; modern studies of the disintegration
of personality have shown this to be a questionable assumption,
undermined by the many facts of normal and abnormal psychology
best resumed under Dr Morton Prince&#8217;s term &#8216;co-consciousness.&#8217;</p>

<p>The individual mind is a system of purposive forces, but the
system is by no means always a harmonious system; it is but too
apt to be the scene of fierce conflicts which sometimes (in the graver
psychoneuroses) result in the rupture and disintegration of the
system. I do not know how otherwise we are to describe the individual
mind than as a system of mental forces; and, until Maciver
succeeds in showing in what other sense he conceives it to have
&#8220;a unity other than that of such a system,&#8221; his objection cannot be
seriously entertained. He asks, of the alleged collective mind:
&#8220;Does the system so created think and will and feel and act<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>?&#8221;
My answer, as set out in the following pages, is that it does all of
these things. He asks further: &#8220;If a number of minds construct by
their interactivity an organisation &#8216;which can only be described in
terms of mind,&#8217; must we ascribe to the construction the very nature
of the forces which constructed it?&#8221; To this I reply&mdash;my point is
that the individual minds which enter into the structure of the group
mind at any moment of its life do not construct it; rather, as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
come to reflective self-consciousness, they find themselves already
members of the system, moulded by it, sharing in its activities,
influenced by it at every moment in every thought and feeling and
action in ways which they can neither fully understand nor escape
from, struggle as they may to free themselves from its infinitely
subtle and multitudinous forces. And this system, as Maciver himself
forcibly insists in another connection, does not consist of relations
that exist external to and independently of the things related,
namely the minds of individuals; it consists of the same stuff as
the individual minds, its threads and parts lie within these minds;
but the parts in the several individual minds reciprocally imply
and complement one another and together make up the system
which consists wholly of them; and therefore, as I wrote, they can
&#8220;only be described in terms of mind.&#8221; Any society is literally a more
or less organised mental system; the stuff of which it consists is
mental stuff; the forces that operate within it are mental forces.
Maciver argues further: &#8220;Social organisations occur of every kind
and every degree of universality. If England has a collective mind,
why not Birmingham and why not each of its wards? If a nation
has a collective mind, so also have a church and a trade union. And
we shall have collective minds that are parts of greater collective
minds, and collective minds that intersect other collective minds.&#8221;
By this my withers are quite unwrung. What degree of organisation
is necessary before a society can properly be said to enjoy collective
mental life or have a group mind is a question of degree; and the
exponent of the group mind is under no obligation to return a precise
answer to this question. My contention is that the most highly
organised groups display collective mental life in a way which justifies
the conception of the group mind, and that we shall be helped to
understand collective life in these most complex and difficult forms
by studying it in the simpler less elaborated groups where the conception
of a group mind is less clearly applicable. As regards the
overlapping and intersection of groups and the consequent difficulty
of assigning the limits of groups whose unity is implied by the term
group mind, I would point out that this difficulty arises only in
connexion with the lower forms of group life and that a parallel
difficulty is presented by the lower forms of animal life. Is Maciver
acquainted with the organisation of a sponge, or of the so-called
coral &#8216;insect,&#8217; or with that of the Portuguese man-o&#8217;-war? Would
he deny the unity of a human being, or refuse to acknowledge his
possession of a mind, because in these lower organisms the limits of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the unit are hard or impossible to assign? Maciver goes on: &#8220;The
second argument is an obvious fallacy. If each man thinks and acts
differently as a member of a crowd or association and as an individual
standing out of any such immediate relation to his fellows, it is still
each who thinks and acts; the new determinations are determinations
still of individual minds as they are influenced by aggregation....
But this is merely an extreme instance of the obvious fact that every
mind is influenced by every kind of environment. To posit a super-individual
mind because individual minds are altered by their
relations to one another (as indeed they are altered by their relations
to physical conditions) is surely gratuitous<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.&#8221; To this I reply&mdash;the
environment which influences the individual in his life as a
member of an organised group is neither the sum of his fellow
members as individuals, nor is it something that has other than a
mental existence. It is the organised group as such, which exists
only or chiefly in the persons of those composing it, but which does
not exist in the mind of any one of them, and which operates upon
each so powerfully just because it is something indefinitely greater,
more powerful, more comprehensive than the mere sum of those
individuals. Maciver feels that &#8220;it is important to clear out of the
way this misleading doctrine of super-individual minds corresponding
to social or communal organisations and activities,&#8221; and therefore
goes on to say that &#8220;there is no more a great &#8216;collective&#8217; mind
beyond the individual minds in society than there is a great &#8216;collective&#8217;
tree beyond all the individual trees in nature. A collection
of trees is a wood, and that we can study as a unity; so an aggregation
of men is a society, a much more determinate unity; but a collection
of trees is not a collective tree, and neither is a collection of persons
or minds a collective person or mind. We can speak of qualities of
tree in abstraction from any particular tree, and we can speak of
qualities of mind as such, or of some particular kind of mind in
relation to some type of situation. Yet in so doing we are simply
considering the characteristic of like elements of individual minds,
as we might consider the characteristic or like elements discoverable
in individual trees and kinds of trees. To conceive because of these
identities, a &#8216;collective&#8217; mind as existing <i>beside</i> those of individuals
or a collective tree beside the variant examples is to run against the
wall of the Idea theory.&#8221; Now, I am not proposing to commit
myself to this last-named theory. It is not because minds have
much in common with one another that I speak of the collective
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
mind, but because the group as such is more than the sum of the
individuals, has its own life proceeding according to laws of group
life, which are not the laws of individual life, and because its peculiar
group life reacts upon and profoundly modifies the lives of the
individuals. I would not call a forest a collective tree; but I would
maintain that in certain respects a forest, a wood, or a copse, has
in a rudimentary way a collective life. Thus the forest remains the
same forest though, after a hundred or a thousand years, all its
constituent trees may be different individuals; and again the forest
as a whole may and does modify the life of each tree, as by attracting
moisture, protecting from violent and cold winds, harbouring various
plants and animals which affect the trees, and so on.</p>

<p>But I will cite an eloquent passage from a recent work on sociology
in support of my view. &#8220;The bonds of society are in the members
of society, and not outside them. It is the memories, traditions, and
beliefs of each which make up the social memories, traditions and
beliefs. Society like the kingdom of God is within us. Within us,
within each of us, and yet greater than the thoughts and understandings
of any of us. For the social thoughts and feelings and
willings of each, the socialised mind of each, with the complex scheme
of his relation to the social world, is no mere reproduction of the
social thoughts and feelings and willings of the rest. Unity and
difference here too weave their eternal web, the greater social scheme
which none of us who are part of it can ever see in its entirety, but
whose infinite subtlety and harmony we may more and more comprehend
and admire. As a community grows in civilisation and
culture, its traditions are no longer clear and definite ways of thinking,
its usages are no longer uniform, its spirit is no longer to be summed
up in a few phrases. But the spirit and tradition of a people become
no less real in becoming more complex. Each member no longer
embodies the whole tradition, but it is because each embodies some
part of a greater tradition to which the freely-working individuality
of each contributes. In this sense the spirit of a people, though
existing only in the individual members, more and more surpasses
the measure of any individual mind. Again, the social tradition is
expressed through institutions and records more permanent than the
short-lived members of community. These institutions and records
are as it were stored social values (just as, in particular, books may
be called stored social knowledge), <i>in themselves nothing</i>, no part of
the social mind, but the instruments of the communication of traditions
from member to member, as also from the dead past to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
living present. In this way too, with the increase of these stored
values, of which members realise parts but none the whole, the spirit
of a people more and more surpasses the measure of any individual
mind. It is these social forces within and without, working in the
minds of individuals whose own social inheritance is an essential
part of their individuality, stored in the institutions which they
maintain from the past or establish in the present, that mould the
communal spirit of the successive generations. In this sense too
a community may be called greater than its members who exist at
any one time, since the community itself marches out of the past
into the present, and its members at any time are part of a great
succession, themselves first moulded by communal forces before they
become, so moulded, the active determinants of its future moulding.&#8221;
An admirable statement! &#8220;The greater social scheme which none
of us can see in its entirety&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;the spirit of a people&#8221; which &#8220;more
and more surpasses the measure of any individual mind&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;the
communal spirit of the successive generations&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;the community&#8221;
which is &#8220;greater than its members who exist at any one time&#8221;;
all these are alternative designations of that organised system of
mental forces which exists over and above, though not independently
of, the individuals in each of whom some fragment of it is embodied
and which is the group mind. And the writer of this statement is
Mr R. M. Maciver; the passage occurs in the section of his book
designed to &#8220;clear out of the way this misleading doctrine of super-individual
minds.&#8221; In the same section he goes on to say that
&#8220;every association, every organised group, may and does have rights
and obligations which are not the rights and obligations of any or
all of its members taken distributively but only of the association
acting as an organised unity.... As a unity the association may
become a &#8216;juristic person,&#8217; a &#8216;corporation,&#8217; and from the legal standpoint
the character of unity so conceived is very important.... The
&#8216;juristic person&#8217; is a real <i>unity</i>, and therefore more than a <i>persona
ficta</i>, but the reality it possesses is of a totally different order of
being from that of the persons who establish it.&#8221; But, perversely as
it seems to me, Maciver adds &#8220;the unity of which we are thinking
is not mechanic or organic or even psychic.&#8221; I cannot but think
that, in thus denying the organic and psychic nature of this unity,
Maciver is under the influence of that unfortunate and still prevalent
way of thinking of the psychic as identical with the conscious which
has given endless trouble in psychology; because it has prompted
the hopeless attempt, constantly renewed, to describe the structure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and organisation of the mind in terms of conscious stuff, ignoring
the all-important distinction between mental activity, which is
sometimes, though perhaps not always, consciousness, and mental
structure which is not. The structure and organisation of the spirit
of the community is in every respect as purely mental or psychic
as is the structure and organisation of the individual mind.</p>

<p>Maciver very properly goes on to bring his conclusions to the
pragmatic test, the test of practical results. He writes: &#8220;These false
analogies ... are the sources of that most misleading antithesis which
we draw between the individual and society, as though society were
somehow other than its individuals.... Analyse these misleading
analogies, and in the revelation of their falsity there is revealed also
the falsity of this essential opposition of individual and society.
Properly understood, the interests of &#8216;the individual&#8217; are the interests
of society<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.&#8221; But is it true that the interests of the individual are
identical with the interests of society? Obviously not. We have
only to think of the condemned criminal; of the mentally defective
to whom every enlightened society should deny the right of procreation;
of the young soldier who sacrifices his health, his limbs, his
eyesight, or his life, and perhaps the welfare of his loved ones, in
serving his country. It is true that the progress of society is essentially
an approximation towards an ideal state in which this identification
would be completed; but that is an ideal which can never be absolutely
realised. Nor is it even true that the interests of society are
identical with the interests of the majority of its members existing
at any one time. It is, I think, highly probable that, if any great
modern nation should unanimously and wholeheartedly embark upon
a thorough-going scheme of state-socialism, the interests of the vast
majority of individuals would be greatly promoted; they would be
enabled to live more prosperously and comfortably with greater
leisure and opportunity for the higher forms of activity. It is, however,
equally probable that the higher interests of the nation would
be gravely endangered, that it would enter upon a period of increasing
stagnation and diminishing vitality and, after a few generations had
passed away, would have slipped far down the slope which has led
all great societies of the past to destruction.</p>

<p>The question may be considered in relation to the German nation.
As will be pointed out in a later chapter, the structure of that nation
was, before the Great War, a menace to European civilisation. If
the Germans had succeeded in their aims and had conquered Europe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
or the world, their individual interests would have been vastly promoted;
they would have enjoyed immense material prosperity and
a proud consciousness of having been chosen by God to rule the rest
of mankind for their good. And this would have confirmed the nation
in all its vices and would have finally crushed out of it all its potentialities
for developing into a well-organised nation of the higher
type, fitted to play an honourable part in the future evolution of
mankind. The same truth appears if we consider the problem of
the responsibility of the German nation for the War. So long as that
people might retain its former organisation, which, I repeat, rendered
it a menace to the civilisation and culture of the whole world, its
antagonists could only treat it as a criminal and an outlaw to be
repressed at all costs and punished and kept down with the utmost
severity. But, if it should achieve a new organisation, one which
will give preponderance to the better and saner elements and traditions
still preserved within it, then, although it will consist of the
same individuals in the main, it will have become a new or at least
a transformed nation, one with which the other nations could enter
into normal relations of amity or at least of mutual toleration, one
which could be admitted to a place in the greater society which the
League of Nations is to become. In other words, the same population
would in virtue of a changed organisation, have become a different
nation.</p>

<p>Although Maciver, in making his attack upon the conception of
the group mind, has done me the honour to choose me as its exponent,
I do not stand alone in maintaining it. I am a little shy of citing
in its support the philosophers of the school of German &#8216;idealism,&#8217;
because, as I have indicated in the Preface, I have little sympathy
with that school. Yet, though one may disapprove of the methods
and of most of the conclusions of a school of thought, one may still
adduce in support of one&#8217;s opinion such of its principles as seem to
be well founded. I may, then, remind the reader that the conception
of the State as a super-individual, a superhuman quasi-divine personality,
is the central conception of the political philosophy of
German &#8216;idealism.&#8217; That conception has, no doubt, played a
considerable part in bringing upon Europe its present disaster.
It was an instance of one of those philosophical ideas which
claim to be the product of pure reason, yet in reality are
adopted for the purpose of justifying and furthering some already
existing interest or institution. In this case the institution in question
was the Prussian state and those, Hegel and the rest, who set up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
this doctrine were servants of that state. They made of their doctrine
an instrument for the suppression of individuality which greatly aided
in producing the servile condition of the German people. Yet the
distortions and exaggerations of the political philosophy of German
&#8216;idealism&#8217; should not prejudice us against the germ of truth which
it contains; and the more enlightened British disciples of this school,
from T.H. Green onwards, have sought with much success to winnow
the grain from the chaff of the doctrine; and I cannot adduce better
support for the conception of the group mind than the sentences in
which a recent English writer, a sympathetic student of German
&#8216;idealism,&#8217; sums up the results of this winnowing process<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Discussing
the deficiencies of the individualist philosophy of the English
utilitarian school, he writes: &#8220;Not a modification of the old Benthamite
premises, but a new philosophy was needed; and that
philosophy was provided by the idealist school, of which Green is
the greatest representative. That school drew its inspiration immediately
from Kant and Hegel, and ultimately from the old Greek
philosophy of the city-state. The vital relation between the life of
the individual and the life of the community, which alone gives the
individual worth and significance, because it alone gives him the
power of full moral development; the dependence of the individual,
for all his rights and for all his liberty, on his membership of the
community; the correlative duty of the community to guarantee to
the individual all his rights (in other words, all the conditions
necessary for his, and therefore for its own, full moral development)&mdash;these
were the premisses of the new philosophy. That philosophy
could satisfy the new needs of social progress, because it refused to
worship a supposed individual liberty which was proving destructive
of the real liberty of the vast majority, and preferred to emphasise
the moral well-being and betterment of the whole community, and
to conceive of each of its members as attaining his own well-being
and betterment in and through the community. Herein lay, or
seemed to lie, a revolution of ideas. Instead of starting from a
central individual, to whom the social system is supposed to be
adjusted, the idealist starts from a central social system, in which
the individual must find his appointed orbit of duty. But after all
the revolution is only a restoration; and what is restored is simply
the <i>Republic</i> of Plato<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.&#8221; The same writer reminds us that &#8220;both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Plato and Hegel thus imply the idea of a moral organism&#8221;; and he
adds, &#8220;It is this conception of a moral organism which Bradley
urges. It is implied in daily experience, and it is the only explanation
of that experience. &#8216;In fact, what we call an individual man is what
he is because of and by virtue of community, and communities are
not mere names, but something real.&#8217; Already at birth the child is
what he is in virtue of communities: he has something of the family
character, something of the national character, something of the
civilised character which comes from human society. As he grows,
the community in which he lives pours itself into his being in the
language he learns and the social atmosphere he breathes, so that
the content of his being implies in its every fibre relations of community.
He is what he is by including in his essence the relations
of the social State.... And regarding the State as a system, in which
many spheres (the family, for instance) are subordinated to one
sphere, and all the particular actions of individuals are subordinated
to their various spheres, we may call it a moral organism, a systematic
whole informed by a common purpose or function. As such
it has an outer side&mdash;a body of institutions; it has an inner side&mdash;a
soul or spirit which sustains that body. And since it is a moral
organism&mdash;since, that is to say, its parts are themselves conscious
moral agents&mdash;that spirit resides in those parts and lives in their
consciousness. In such an organism&mdash;and this is where it differs
from an animal organism, and why we have to use the word moral&mdash;the
parts are conscious: they know themselves in their position as
parts of the whole, and they therefore know the whole of which they
are parts. So far as they have such knowledge, and a will based
upon it, so far is the moral organism self-conscious and self-willing....
Thus, on the one hand, we must recognise that the State lives;
that there is a nation&#8217;s soul, self-conscious in its citizens; and that
to each citizen this living soul assigns his field of accomplishment<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.&#8221;
On a later page of the same book we read&mdash;&#8220;All the institutions of
a country, so far as they are effective, are not only products of
thought and creations of mind: they <i>are</i> thought, and they <i>are</i> mind.
Otherwise we have a building without a tenant, and a body without
a mind. An Oxford college is not a group of buildings, though
common speech gives that name to such a group: it is a group of
men. But it is not a group of men in the sense of a group of bodies
in propinquity: it is a group of men in the sense of a group of minds.
That group of minds, in virtue of the common substance of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
uniting idea, is itself a group-mind. There is no group-mind existing
apart from the minds of the members of the group; the group-mind
only exists in the minds of its members. But nevertheless it exists.
There is a college mind, just as there is a Trade Union mind, or even
a &#8216;public mind&#8217; of the whole community; and we are all conscious
of such a mind as something that exists in and along with the separate
minds of the members, and over and above any sum of those minds
created by mere addition<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The political philosophers of the idealist school have not stood
alone in recognising the reality of the group mind. Some of the
lawyers, notably Maitland, have arrived at a very similar doctrine;
and I cannot better summarise their conclusions than Barker has
done in the following passage in the book from which I have already
cited so freely. &#8220;The new doctrine,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;runs somewhat as
follows. No permanent group, permanently organised for a durable
object, can be regarded as a mere sum of persons, whose union, to
have any rights or duties, must receive a legal confirmation. Permanent
groups are themselves persons, group-persons, with a
group-will of their own and a permanent character of their own;
and they have become group-persons of themselves, without any
creative act of the State. In a word, group-persons are real persons;
and just because they are so, and possess such attributes of persons
as will and character, they cannot have been made by the State<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not alone, then, in postulating the reality of the group mind.
And I am glad to be able to cite evidence of this, because I know
well that very many readers may at first find themselves repelled by
this notion of a group mind, and that some of them will incline to
regard it as the fantastic fad of an academic crank.</p>

<p>I would say at once that the crucial point of difference between
my own view of the group mind and that of the German &#8216;idealist&#8217;
school (at least in its more extreme representatives) is that I
repudiate, provisionally at least, as an unverifiable hypothesis the
conception of a collective or super-individual consciousness, somehow
comprising the consciousness of the individuals composing the group.
I have examined this conception in the following chapter and have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
stated my grounds for rejecting it. The difference of practical conclusions
arising from this difference of theory must obviously be
very great.</p>

<p>Several books dealing with collective psychology have been published
in recent years. Of these perhaps the most notable are
G. le Bon&#8217;s <i>Psychology of the Crowd</i>, his <i>Evolution psychologique
des peuples</i>; Sighele&#8217;s <i>La foule criminelle</i>; the <i>Psychologie collective</i>
of Dr A. A. Marie; and Alfred Fouill&eacute;e&#8217;s <i>La Science sociale contemporaine</i>.
It is noteworthy that, with the exception of the last,
all these books deal only with crowds or groups of low organisation;
and their authors, like almost all others who have touched on this
subject, are concerned chiefly to point out how participation in the
group life degrades the individual, how the group feels and thinks
and acts on a much lower plane than the average plane of the
individuals who compose it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many writers have insisted on the fact that
it is only by participation in the life of society that any man can
realise his higher potentialities; that society has ideals and aims and
traditions loftier than any principles of conduct the individual can
form for himself unaided; and that only by the further evolution of
organised society can mankind be raised to higher levels; just as in
the past it has been only through the development of organised
society that the life of man has ceased to deserve the epithets &#8216;nasty,
brutish and short&#8217; which Hobbes applied to it.</p>

<p>We seem then to stand before a paradox. Participation in group
life degrades the individual, assimilating his mental processes to
those of the crowd, whose brutality, inconstancy, and unreasoning
impulsiveness have been the theme of many writers; yet only by
participation in group life does man become fully man, only so does
he rise above the level of the savage.</p>

<p>The resolution of this paradox is the essential theme of this book.
It examines and fully recognises the mental and moral defects of
the crowd and its degrading effects upon all those who are caught
up in it and carried away by the contagion of its reckless spirit. It
then goes on to show how organisation of the group may, and
generally does in large measure, counteract these degrading tendencies;
and how the better kinds of organisation render group life
the great ennobling influence by aid of which alone man rises a little
above the animals and may even aspire to fellowship with the angels.</p>

PSYCHOLOGY</h4>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>THE MENTAL LIFE OF THE CROWD</h4>

<p>It is a notorious fact that, when a number of men think and feel
and act together, the mental operations and the actions of each
member of the group are apt to be very different from those he would
achieve if he faced the situation as an isolated individual. Hence,
though we may know each member of a group so intimately that
we can, with some confidence, foretell his actions under given
circumstances, we cannot foretell the behaviour of the group from
our knowledge of the individuals alone. If we would understand and
be able to predict the behaviour of the group, we must study the
way in which the mental processes of its members are modified
in virtue of their membership. That is to say, we must study the
interactions between the members of the group and also those
between the group as a whole and each member. We must examine
also the forms of group organisation and their influence upon the
life of the group.</p>

<p>Groups differ greatly from one another in respect of the kind and
degree of organisation they possess. In the simplest case the group
has no organisation. In some cases the relations of the constituent
individuals to one another and to the whole group are not in any
way determined or fixed by previous events; such a group constitutes
merely a mob. In other groups the individuals have certain determinate
relations to one another which have arisen in one or more
of three ways:</p>

<p>(1) Certain relations may have been established between the
individuals, before they came together to form a group; for
example, a parish council or a political meeting may be formed
by persons belonging to various definitely recognised classes, and
their previously recognised relations will continue to play a part in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
determining the collective deliberations and actions of the group;
they will constitute an incipient organisation.</p>

<p>(2) If any group enjoys continuity of existence, certain more or
less constant relations, of subordination, deference, leadership and
so forth, will inevitably become established between the individuals
of which it is composed; and, of course, such relations will usually
be deliberately established and maintained by any group that is
united by a common purpose, in order that its efficiency may be
promoted.</p>

<p>(3) The group may have a continued existence and a more or
less elaborate and definite organisation independently of the individuals
of which it is composed; in such a case the individuals may
change while the formal organisation of the group persists; each
person who enters it being received into some more or less well-defined
and generally recognised position within the group, which
formal position determines in great measure the nature of his relations
to other members of the group and to the group as a whole.</p>

<p>We can hardly imagine any concourse of human beings, however
fortuitous it may be, utterly devoid of the rudiments of organisation
of one or other of these three kinds; nevertheless, in many a fortuitous
concourse the influence of such rudimentary organisation is
so slight as to be negligible. Such a group is an unorganised crowd
or mob. The unorganised crowd presents many of the fundamental
phenomena of collective psychology in relative simplicity;
whereas the higher the degree of organisation of a group, the
more complicated is its psychology. We shall, therefore, study first
the mental peculiarities of the unorganised crowd, and shall then
go on to consider the modifications resulting from a simple and
definite type of organisation.</p>

<p>Not every mass of human beings gathered together in one place
within sight and sound of one another constitutes a crowd in the
psychological sense of the word. There is a dense gathering of several
hundred individuals at the Mansion House Crossing at noon of every
week-day; but ordinarily each of them is bent upon his own task,
pursues his own ends, paying little or no regard to those about him.
But let a fire-engine come galloping through the throng of traffic,
or the Lord Mayor&#8217;s state coach arrive, and instantly the concourse
assumes in some degree the character of a psychological crowd. All
eyes are turned upon the fire-engine or coach; the attention of all
is directed to the same object; all experience in some degree the
same emotion, and the state of mind of each person is in some degree
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
affected by the mental processes of all those about him. Those are
the fundamental conditions of collective mental life. In its more
developed forms, an awareness of the crowd or group as such in the
mind of each member plays an important part; but this is not an
essential condition of its simpler manifestations. The essential conditions
of collective mental action are, then, a common object of
mental activity, a common mode of feeling in regard to it, and some
degree of reciprocal influence between the members of the group.
It follows that not every aggregation of individuals is capable of
becoming a psychological crowd and of enjoying a collective life.
For the individuals must be capable of being interested in the same
objects and of being affected in a similar way by them; there must
be a certain degree of similarity of mental constitution among the
individuals, a certain mental homogeneity of the group. Let a man
stand on a tub in the midst of a gathering of a hundred Englishmen
and proceed to denounce and abuse England; those individuals at
once become a crowd. Whereas, if the hundred men were of as
many races and nations, their attention would hardly be attracted
by the orator; for they would have no common interest in the topic
of his discourse. Or let the man on the tub denounce the establishment
of the Church of England, and the hundred Englishmen do
not become a crowd; for, although all may be interested and attentive,
the words of the orator evoke in them very diverse feelings and
emotions, the sentiments they entertain for the Church of England
being diverse in character.</p>

<p>There must, then, be some degree of similarity of mental constitution,
of interest and sentiment, among the persons who form
a crowd, a certain degree of mental homogeneity of the group. And
the higher the degree of this mental homogeneity of any gathering
of men, the more readily do they form a psychological crowd and
the more striking and intense are the manifestations of collective
life. All gatherings of men that are not purely fortuitous are apt to
have a considerable degree of mental homogeneity; thus the members
of a political meeting are drawn together by common political
opinions and sentiments; the audience in a concert room shares a
common love of music or a common admiration for the composer,
conductor, or great executant; and a still higher degree of homogeneity
prevails when a number of persons of the same religious
persuasion are gathered together at a great revival meeting. Consider
how under such circumstances a very ordinary joke or point made
by a political orator provokes a huge delight; how, at a concert,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the admiration of the applauding audience swells to a pitch of
frantic enthusiasm; how, at the skilfully conducted and successful
revival meeting, the fervour of emotion is apt to rise, until it exceeds
all normal modes of expression and men and women give way to
loud weeping or even hysterical convulsions.</p>

<p>Such exaltation or intensification of emotion is the most striking
result of the formation of a crowd, and is one of the principal sources
of the attractiveness of the crowd. By participation in the mental
life of a crowd, one&#8217;s emotions are stirred to a pitch that they seldom
or never attain under other conditions. This is for most men an
intensely pleasurable experience; they are, as they say, carried out
of themselves, they feel themselves caught up in a great wave of
emotion, and cease to be aware of their individuality and all its
limitations; that isolation of the individual, which oppresses every
one of us, though it may not be explicitly formulated in his consciousness,
is for the time being abolished. The repeated enjoyment of
effects of this kind tends to generate a craving for them, and also
a facility in the spread and intensification of emotion in this way;
this is probably the principal cause of the greater excitability of
urban populations as compared with dwellers in the country, and
of the well-known violence and fickleness of the mobs of great
cities.</p>

<p>There is one kind of object in the presence of which no man remains
indifferent and which evokes in almost all men the same emotion,
namely impending danger; hence the sudden appearance of imminent
danger may instantaneously convert any concourse of people into
a crowd and produce the characteristic and terrible phenomena of
a panic. In each man the instinct of fear is intensely excited; he
experiences that horrible emotion in full force and is irresistibly
impelled to save himself by flight. The terrible driving power of
this impulse, excited to its highest pitch under the favouring conditions,
suppresses all other impulses and tendencies, all habits of
self-restraint, of courtesy and consideration for others; and we see
men, whom we might have supposed incapable of cruel or cowardly
behaviour, trampling upon women and children, in their wild efforts
to escape from the burning theatre, the sinking ship, or other place
of danger.</p>

<p>The panic is the crudest and simplest example of collective
mental life. Groups of gregarious animals are liable to panic; and
the panic of a crowd of human beings seems to be generated by the
same simple instinctive reactions as the panic of animals. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
essence of the panic is the collective intensification of the instinctive
excitement, with its emotion of fear and its impulse to night. The
principle of primitive sympathy<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> seems to afford a full and adequate
explanation of such collective intensification of instinctive excitement.
The principle is that, in man and in the gregarious animals
generally, each instinct, with its characteristic primary emotion and
specific impulse, is capable of being excited in one individual by the
expressions of the same emotion in another, in virtue of a special
congenital adaptation of the instinct on its Cognitive or perceptual
side. In the crowd, then, the expressions of fear of each individual
are perceived by his neighbours; and this perception intensifies the
fear directly excited in them by the threatening danger. Each man
perceives on every hand the symptoms of fear, the blanched distorted
faces, the dilated pupils, the high-pitched trembling voices, and the
screams of terror of his fellows; and with each such perception his
own impulse and his own emotion rise to a higher pitch of intensity,
and their expressions become correspondingly accentuated and more
difficult to control. So the expressions of each member of the crowd
work upon all other members within sight and hearing of him to
intensify their excitement; and the accentuated expressions of the
emotion, so intensified, react upon him to raise his own excitement
to a still higher pitch; until in all individuals the instinct is excited
in the highest possible degree.</p>

<p>This principle of direct induction of emotion by way of the
primitive sympathetic response enables us to understand the fact
that a concourse of people (or animals) may be quickly turned into a
panic-stricken crowd by some threatening object which is perceptible
by only a few of the individuals present. A few persons near the
stage of a theatre see flames dart out among the wings; then, though
the flames may be invisible to the rest of the house, the expressions
of the startled few induce fear in their neighbours, and the excitement
sweeps over the whole concourse like fire blown across the
prairie.</p>

<p>The same principle enables us to understand how a few fearless
individuals may arrest the spread of a panic. If they experience no
fear, or can completely arrest its expressions, and can in any way
make themselves prominent, can draw and hold the attention of
their fellows to themselves, then these others, instead of perceiving
on every hand only the expressions of fear, perceive these few calm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and resolute individuals; the process of reciprocal intensification of
the excitement is checked and, if the danger is not too imminent
and obvious, the panic may die away, leaving men ashamed and
astonished at the intensity of their emotion and the violent irrational
character of their behaviour.</p>

<p>Other of the cruder primary emotions may spread through a
crowd in very similar fashion, though the process is rarely so rapid
and intense as in the case of fear<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. And in every case the principal
cause of the intensification of the emotion is the reciprocal action
between the members of the crowd, according to the principle of
sympathetic induction of emotion in one individual by its expressions
in others.</p>

<p>In panic, the dominance of the one emotion and its impulse is so
complete as to allow no scope for any of the subtler modes of collective
mental operation. But in other cases other conditions co-operate
to determine the character of the emotional response of the crowd.
Of these the most important are the awareness of the crowd as a
whole in the mind of each member of it and his consciousness of his
membership in the whole. When a common emotion pervades the
crowd, each member becomes more or less distinctly aware of the
fact; and this gives him a sense of sharing in a mighty and irresistible
power which renders him reckless of consequences and encourages
him to give himself up to the prevailing emotion without restraint.
Thus, in the case of an audience swept by an emotion of admiration
for a brilliant singer, the thunder of applause, which shows each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
individual that his emotion is shared by all the rest, intensifies his
own emotion, not only by way of sympathetic induction, but also
because it frees him from that restraint of emotion which is habitual
with most of us in the presence of any critical or adversely disposed
spectators, and which the mere thought of such spectators tends to
maintain and strengthen. Again, the oratory of a demagogue, if
addressed to a large crowd, will raise angry emotion to a pitch of
intensity far higher than any it will attain if he is heard by a few
persons only; and this is due not only to accentuation of the
emotion by sympathetic induction, but also to the fact that, as
the symptoms of the emotion begin to be manifested on all sides,
each man becomes aware that it pervades the crowd, that the
crowd as a whole is swayed by the same emotion and the same
impulse as he himself feels, that none remains to criticise the
violence of his expressions. To which it must be added that the
consciousness of the harmony of one&#8217;s feelings with those of a
mass of one&#8217;s fellows, and the consequent sense of freedom from
all restraint, are highly pleasurable to most men; they find a
pleasure in letting themselves go, in being swept away in the torrent
of collective emotion. This is one of the secrets of the fascination
which draws many thousands of spectators to a football match, and
brings together the multitudes of base-ball &#8216;fans&#8217; bubbling over with
eager anticipation of an emotional orgy.</p>

<p>The fact that the emotions of crowds are apt to be very violent
has long been recognised, and the popular mind, in seeking to account
for it, has commonly postulated very special and even supernatural
causes. The negro author of a most interesting book<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> has given the
following description of the religious frenzy of a crowd of Christian
negroes: &#8220;An air of intense excitement possessed the mass of black
folk. A suppressed terror hung in the air and seemed to seize us,&mdash;a
pythian madness, a demoniac possession, that lent terrible reality
to song and word. The massive form of the preacher swayed and
quivered as the words crowded to his lips. The people moaned and
fluttered and then a gaunt brown woman suddenly leaped into the
air and shrieked like a lost soul, while round about came wail and
groan and outcry, a scene of human passion such as I had never
even imagined.&#8221; The author goes on to say that this frenzy is attributed
by the black folk to the direct influence of the Spirit of the
Lord, making mad the worshippers with supernatural joy, and that
this belief is one of the leading features of their religion. Similar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
practices, depending upon the tendency of collective emotion to rise
to an extreme intensity, have been common to the peoples of many
lands in all ages; and similar supernatural explanations have been
commonly devised and accepted. I need only remind the reader of
the Dionysiac orgies of ancient Greece.</p>

<p>The facts are so striking that for the popular mind they remain
unaccountable, and not to be mentioned without some vague
reference to magnetism, electricity, hypnotism, or some mysterious
contagion; and even modern scientific writers have been led to adopt
somewhat extravagant hypotheses to account for them. Thus
Dr Le Bon<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> speaks of &#8220;the magnetic influence given out by the
crowd&#8221; and says that, owing to this influence, &#8220;or from some other
cause of which we are ignorant, an individual immerged for some
length of time in a crowd in action soon finds himself in a special
state, which much resembles the state of fascination in which the
hypnotised individual finds himself in the hands of the hypnotiser.&#8221;
He goes on to say that in the hypnotised subject the conscious
personality disappears and that his actions are the outcome of the
unconscious activities of the spinal cord. Now, crowds undoubtedly
display great suggestibility, but great suggestibility does not necessarily
imply hypnosis; and there is no ground for supposing that the
members of a crowd are thrown into any such condition, save
possibly in very rare instances.</p>

<p>There are however two hypotheses, sometimes invoked for the
explanation of the peculiarities of collective mental life, which
demand serious consideration and which we may with advantage
consider at this point.</p>

<p>One is the hypothesis of telepathy. A considerable amount of
respectable evidence has been brought forward in recent years to
prove that one mind may directly influence another by some obscure
mode of action that does not involve the known organs of
expression and of perception; and much of this evidence seems
to show that one mind may directly induce in another a state of
consciousness similar to its own. If, then, such direct interaction
between two minds can take place in an easily appreciable
degree in certain instances, it would seem not improbable that a
similar direct interaction, producing a lesser, and therefore less easily
appreciable, degree of assimilation of the states of consciousness of
the minds concerned, may be constantly and normally at work. If
this were the case, such telepathic interaction might well play a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
important part in collective mental life, and, where a large number
of persons is congregated, it might tend to produce that intensification
of emotion which is so characteristic of crowds. In fact, if direct
telepathic communication of emotion in however slight a degree is
possible and normal, and especially if the influence is one that
diminishes with distance, it may be expected to produce its most
striking results among the members of a crowd; for the emotion of
each member might be expected to be intensified by the telepathic
influence radiating from every other member. Some slight presumption
in favour of such a mode of explanation is afforded by the
fact that the popular use of the word contagion in the present connexion
seems to imply, however vaguely, some such direct communication
of emotion. But telepathic communication has not hitherto
been indisputably established; and the observations that afford so
strong a presumption in its favour indicate that, if and in so far as
it occurs, it does so sporadically and only between individuals
specially attuned to one another or in some abnormal mental state
that renders them specially sensitive to the influence<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. And, while
the acceptance of the principle of sympathetic induction of an
emotion, as an instinctive perceptual response to the expressions of
that emotion, renders unnecessary any further principle of explanation,
the consideration of the conditions of the spread of emotion
through crowds affords evidence that this mode of interaction of
the individuals is all-important and that telepathic communication,
if it occurs, is of secondary importance. For the spreading and the
great intensification of emotion seem to depend upon its being given
expressions that are perceptible by the senses. So long as its expressions
are suppressed, the emotion of an assembly does not
become excessive. It is only by eliciting and encouraging the expressions
of emotions that the revivalist, the political orator, or the
comic man on the music-hall stage, achieves his successes. That the
expressions of an emotion are far more effective in this way than the
emotion itself is recognised by the practice of the <i>claqueurs</i>. When
an audience has once been induced to give expression to a common
emotion, its members are, as it were, set in tune with one another;
each man is aware that he is in harmony with all the rest as regards
his feelings and emotions, and, even in the periods during which all
expressions are suppressed by the audience, this awareness serves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to sustain the mood and to prepare for fresh outbursts. The mere
silence of an audience, the absence of coughs, shufflings, and uneasy
movements, suffices to make each member aware that all his fellows
are attentive and are responding with the appropriate emotion; but
it is not until the applause, the indignation, or the laughter, breaks
out in free expression that the emotion reaches its highest pitch.
And a skilful orator or entertainer, recognising these facts, takes
care to afford frequent opportunities for the collective displays of
emotion.</p>

<p>We must recognise, then, that, even if telepathic communication
be proved to be possible in certain cases, there is not sufficient
evidence of its operation in the spread of emotion through crowds,
and that the facts are sufficiently explained by another principle of
general and indisputable validity, the principle of primitive sympathy.</p>

<p>The second hypothesis to be considered in this connexion is that
of the &#8216;collective consciousness.&#8217; The conception of a collective
consciousness has been reached by a large number of authors along
several lines of observation and reasoning and is seriously defended
at the present time, more especially by several French and German
writers. They maintain that, in some sense and manner, the consciousnesses
of individuals are not wholly shut off from one another,
but may co-operate in the genesis of, or share in the being of, a more
comprehensive consciousness that exists beside and in addition to
them. The conception varies according to the route by which it is
reached and the use that is made of it; but in all its varieties the
conception remains extremely obscure; no one has succeeded in
making clear how the relation of the individual consciousness to
the collective consciousness is to be conceived. In the writings of
many metaphysicians, of whom Hegel is the most prominent, &#8216;the
Absolute&#8217; seems to imply such a collective consciousness, an all-inclusive
world-consciousness of which the individual consciousness
of each man is somehow but a constituent element or fragmentary
manifestation. But it would be unprofitable to attempt any discussion
of the conception. We are concerned only with the empirical
conception of a collective consciousness based on observation and
induction.</p>

<p>Such a conception finds its strongest support in the analogy
afforded by a widely current view of the nature and conditions of
the psychical individuality of men and animals; the view, namely,
that the individual consciousness of any man or animal is the collective
consciousness of the cells of which his body, or his nervous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
system, is composed. We know that the nervous system is made
up of cells each of which is a vital unit, capable of living, of achieving
its essential vital processes, independently of other cells; and we see
free living cells that in many respects are comparable with these and
to which we seem compelled, according to the principle of continuity,
to attribute some germ of psychical life however rudimentary. What
is known of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic development of the
multicellular animal seems to justify us in regarding it as essentially
an aggregate of such independent vital units, which, being formed
by repeated fission from a single cell, adhere together and undergo
differentiation and specialisation of functions. If then the parent
cell, the germ cell, has a rudimentary psychical life, it is difficult to
deny it altogether to the cells formed from it by fission; and it is
argued that all these cells continue to enjoy a psychical life and that
the consciousness of the individual man or animal is the collective
consciousness of some or all of these cells. Now we know that the
consciousness of any one of the higher animals has for its physical
correlate at any moment processes going on simultaneously in many
different parts and elements of the brain. It is argued, then, that
we must suppose each cell of the brain to enjoy, whenever it is active,
its own psychical life, and at the same time to contribute something
towards the unitary &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of the whole organism,
which thus exists beside, but not independently of, these rudimentary
consciousnesses of the cells. If the view be accepted, it affords a
close analogy with the supposed &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of a group
of men or a society.</p>

<p>This conception of the collective nature of the consciousness of
complex organisms finds strong support in two classes of facts. First,
it finds support in the fact that, if individuals of many of the animal
species of an intermediate grade of complexity, such as some of the
worms and some of the radiate animals, be cut into two or more parts,
each part may continue to live and may become a complete organism
by reconstitution of the lost parts. Since, then, we can hardly deny
some integrated psychical life to such organisms, some rudimentary
consciousness, we seem compelled to believe that this consciousness
may be divided into two or more consciousnesses, each of them being
associated with the vital activities of one of the parts into which
the organism is divided by the knife. Division of the organism into
two parts is also the normal mode of reproduction in the animal
world. Even the coming into existence of every human being seems
to be bound up with the separation of a cell from the parent organism;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and his existence as a separate psychical individual seems to result
from the same process of physical division. And if one cell, when thus
separated from the parent organism, can thus prove its possession
of a psychical life by developing into a fully conscious organism,
it is difficult to deny that all other cells have also their own psychical
lives, even though they may be incapable of making it manifest
to us by growing up into complex organisms when separated.</p>

<p>The second class of facts that seem to justify this conception of
the consciousness of complex organisms are facts which have been
studied and discussed widely in recent years under the head of
mental dissociation or disintegration of personalities. Such disintegration
seems to occur spontaneously as the essential feature of
severe hysteria, and to be producible artificially and temporarily in
some subjects, when they are thrown into deep hypnosis. In certain
of these cases the behaviour of the human being seems to imply
that it is the expression of two separate psychical individuals, formed
by the splitting of the stream of consciousness and of mental activity
of the individual into two streams. The two streams may be of
co-ordinate complexity; but more frequently one of them seems to
be a mere trickle diverted from the main stream of personal consciousness.
Since it is, from the nature of the case, always impossible
to obtain any direct and certain proof that any behaviour other
than one&#8217;s own is the expression of conscious mental processes, it is
not possible to prove that such division or disintegration of the
personal consciousness actually takes place. But the facts appear to
many of the psychologists who have studied them most carefully<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
to demand this interpretation; and this psychical disintegration
seems to be accompanied by a functional dissociation of the nervous
system into two or more systems each of which functions independently
of the others,&mdash;that is to say, a division of the nervous
system comparable with the division of the nervous system of the
worm by the stroke of the knife which seems to split the psychical
individual into two.</p>

<p>The facts of both these orders would appear, then, to indicate that
the physical organisation of the cells of a complex organism is accompanied
by an organisation of their psychical lives to form a &#8216;collective
consciousness,&#8217; which in the human being becomes a personal self-consciousness;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and they would seem to show that the unity of personal
consciousness has for its main condition the functional continuity
of the protoplasm of the cells of the nervous system.</p>

<p>Even before the facts of disintegration of personalities were
known, several authors, notably von Hartmann<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and G. T. Fechner<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>,
did not hesitate to make this last assumption; and to assert that,
if the brain of a man could be divided by a knife into two parts
each of which continued to function, his consciousness would thus
be divided into two consciousnesses; and conversely, that, if a
functional bridge of nervous matter could be established between
the brains of two men, their consciousnesses would fuse to a single
consciousness. The discovery of these facts has greatly strengthened
the case for this view; and it has been accepted by so sound a
psychologist and sober a philosopher as Fouill&eacute;e<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>It may be claimed that the consideration of the nature and
behaviour of animal societies points to a similar conclusion, and
supplements in an important manner the argument founded on the
divisibility of individual organisms. Such a line of reasoning has been
most thoroughly pursued by Espinas in his very interesting book
on animal societies<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. He begins by considering the lower polycellular
forms of animal life. Among them, especially among the hydrozoa
or polypes, we find compound or colonial animals; such an animal is
a single living mass of which all the parts are in substantial and
vital connexion with one another, but is yet made up of a number
of parts each of which is morphologically a complete or almost
complete creature; and these parts, though specialised for the performance
of certain functions subserving the economy of the whole
animal or coherent group of animals, are yet capable, if separated
from the mass (as they sometimes are by a natural process), of
continuing to live, of growing, and of multiplying. There are found
among such creatures very various degrees of specialisation of parts
and of interdependence of parts; and in those cases in which the
specialisation and interdependence of parts is great, the whole compound
animal exhibits in its reactions so high a degree of integration
that we seem justified in supposing that a common or &#8216;collective
consciousness&#8217; is the psychical correlate of these integrated actions
of the separable parts. Why then, it is asked, should this &#8216;collective
consciousness&#8217; cease to be, when the substantial continuity of the
parts is interrupted?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p><p>Espinas then goes on to describe animal societies of many types,
and shows how, as we follow up the evolutionary scale, association
and intimate interdependence and co-operation of their members tend
to replace more and more completely the individualistic antagonism
and unmitigated competition of the lowest free-living organisms. He
considers first the type of animal society which is essentially a family,
a society of individuals all of which are derived from the same parent
by fission or by budding. He argues that each such society of
blood-relatives is a harmonious whole only because it enjoys a
&#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; over and above the consciousnesses of its
constituent members; that, for example, a swarm of bees, which
exhibits so great a uniformity of feeling and action and of which all
the members come from the body of one parent, is in reality the
material basis of a &#8216;collective consciousness,&#8217; which presides over
and is expressed by their collective actions; that the ants of one
household have such a collective consciousness, that they &#8220;are, in
truth, a single thought in action, like the various cellules and fibres
of the brain of a mammal.&#8221; For, as he maintains, &#8220;the consciousness
of animals is not an absolute, indivisible thing. It is on the contrary
a reality capable of being divided and diffused ... thought in general
and the impulses illuminated by it, are, like the forces of nature,
susceptible of diffusion, of transmission, of being shared, and can
like these lie dormant where they are thinly diffused, or become
vivid and intensified by concentration. The beings that have these
attributes are no doubt monads; but these monads are open to and
communicate with one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Espinas extends the view to other animal societies of which the
members are not all derived from one parent, including human
societies; and concludes that, except in the case of the Infusoria
at the bottom of the scale and of the highly organised societies at
the top of it, every individual consciousness is a part of a superior
more comprehensive consciousness of an individual of a higher order.
He illustrates at length the fact with the consideration and explanation
of which this chapter is concerned, the fact namely that, in all
social groups, emotions and impulses are communicated and intensified
from one individual to another; and he asks&mdash;&#8220;If the
essential elements of consciousness add themselves together and
accumulate from one consciousness to another, how should the
consciousness itself of the whole not be participated in by each?&#8221;
He argues that to be real is not to be known to some other consciousness,
but is to exist for oneself, to be conscious of oneself; that, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
this sense, the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of a society is the most real
of all things; that every society is therefore a living individual; and
that, if we deny self-conscious individuality to a society, we must
deny it equally to the mass of cells that make up an animal body;
that, in short, we can find unity and individuality nowhere.</p>

<p>This doctrine of the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of societies may
seem bizarre to those to whom it is altogether novel; but it is one
that cannot be lightly put aside; it demands serious consideration
from any one who seeks the general principles of Collective Psychology.
We have no certain knowledge from which its impossibility
can be deduced; and the new light thrown upon individuality by
modern studies in psycho-pathology shows us that the indivisibility
and strictly bounded unity of the individual human soul is a postulate
that we must not continue to accept without critical examination.
Nor is the conception one that figures only in the writings of philosophers
and therefore to be regarded with contemptuous indulgence
by men of affairs as but one of the strange harmless foibles of such
persons. It has a certain vogue in more popular writings; thus
Renan wrote&mdash;&#8220;It has been remarked that in face of a peril a nation
or a city shows, like a living creature, a divination of the common
danger, a secret sentiment of its own being and the need of its
conservation. Such is the obscure impulsion which provokes from
time to time the displacement of a whole people or the emigration
of masses, the crusades, the religious, political, or social revolutions.&#8221;
Phrases such as the soul of a people, the genius of a people, have
long been current, and in almost every newspaper one may find
important events and tendencies ascribed to the instinct of a people.
It is probable that these phrases are written in many instances
without any explicit intention to imply a &#8216;collective national consciousness,&#8217;
but merely as well-sounding words that cloak our
ignorance and give a vague appearance of understanding. Nevertheless,
from its application to the life of nations, the doctrine of
a collective consciousness mainly derives its importance. It is
seriously used by a number of vigorous contemporary writers, of
whom Schaeffle<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> is perhaps the most notable, to carry to its extreme
the doctrine of Comte and Spencer that Society is an organism.
Spencer specifically refused to complete his analogy between society
and an animal organism by the acceptance of the hypothesis of a
collective consciousness; and he insisted strongly on the importance,
for legislation and social effort of every kind, of holding fast to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
consciousness of individual men as the final court of appeal, by
reference to which the value of every institution and every form of
social activity must be judged, the importance of regarding the
welfare and happiness of individual men as the supreme end, in
relation to which the welfare of the State is but a means. But those
who, like Schaeffle, complete the analogy by acceptance of this
hypothesis, regard a nation as an organism in the fullest sense of
the word, as an organism that has its own pleasure and pain and its
own conscious ends and purposes and strivings; as in fact a great
individual which is conscious and may be more or less perfectly
self-conscious, conscious of itself, its past, its future, its purposes,
its joys and its sorrows. And they do not scruple to draw the logical
conclusion that the welfare of the individual should be completely
subjected to that of the State; just as the welfare of an organ or cell
of the human body is rightly held to be of infinitesimal value in
comparison with that of the whole individual and to derive its
importance only from its share in the constitution of the whole.
This conception of the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; has thus been used
as one of the supports of &#8216;Prussianism&#8217; and has played its part in
bringing about the Great War with all its immense mass of individual
anguish.</p>

<p>We must, then, examine the arguments upon which the doctrine
is based, and ask&mdash;Do they suffice to render it probable, or to
compel our acceptance of it, and to justify the complete subjection
of the individual to the State?</p>

<p>We have seen that a strong case is made out for the view that the
consciousness of a complex organism is the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217;
of all its cells, or of the cells of its nervous system; and it must be
admitted that, if this view could be definitely established, it would
go far to justify the doctrine of the collective consciousness of societies.
Yet the view is by no means established; there are great
difficulties in the way of its acceptance. There is the difficulty which
meets a doctrine of &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; in all its forms from
that of Haeckel to that of Hegel,&mdash;the difficulty that the consciousness
of the units is used twice over, once as the individual consciousness,
once as an element entering into the collective consciousness; and
no one has been able to suggest how this difficulty can be surmounted.
It has been argued also, most forcibly perhaps by Lotze<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>,
that what we know of the structure and functions of the brain
compels us to adopt a very different interpretation of the facts. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
is said that, since we cannot find any evidence of a unitary brain-process
that might be regarded as the immediate physical correlate
of the unitary stream of consciousness of the individual, but find
rather that the physical correlate of the individual&#8217;s consciousness
at any moment is a number of discrete processes taking place simultaneously
in anatomical elements widely scattered in different parts
of the brain, we are compelled to assume that each of these acts
upon some unitary substance, some immaterial entity (which may
be called the soul) producing a partial affection of its state. According
to this view, then, the consciousness of any moment is the
unitary resultant of all these influences simultaneously exerted on
the soul, the unitary reaction of the soul upon these many influences<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>But, even if we could accept the view that the consciousness of
the complex organism is the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of its cells,
the analogy between an organism and a society, which constitutes
the argument for the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of a society, would
remain defective in one very important respect. If we accept that
view, we must believe that the essential condition of the fusion of
the consciousnesses of the cells is their spatial continuity, no matter
how utterly unintelligible this condition may seem; for the apparent
disruption of consciousness on the solution of material continuity
between the cells is the principal ground on which this view is
founded. Now, no such continuity of substance exists between the
members of any human group or society, and its absence constitutes
a fatal flaw in the analogical argument.</p>

<p>If we pass by these serious difficulties, others arise as soon as we
inquire what kinds of human groups have such &#8216;collective consciousness.&#8217;
Does the simple fortuitously gathered crowd possess it? Or
is it confined to highly organised groups such as the leading modern
nations? If every psychological crowd possesses it and owes its
peculiarities of behaviour to it, does it come into being at the
moment the individuals have their attention attracted to a common
object and begin to be stirred by a common emotion? And does it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
cease to be as soon as the crowd is resolved into its elements? Or,
if it is confined to nations or other highly organised groups, at what
stage of their development does it come into being, and what are
the limits of the groups of which it is the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217;?
Do the Poles share in the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of the German
nation, or the Bavarians in that of Prussia? Or do the Irish or the
Welsh contribute their share to that of the English nation?</p>

<p>Coming now to close quarters with the doctrine, we may ask
those who, like Schaeffle and Espinas, regard the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217;
as a bond which unites the members of a society and
makes of them one living individual,&mdash;Is this &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217;
merely epiphenomenal in character? Or are we to regard it
as reacting upon the consciousnesses or minds of the individuals of
the group, and, through such reaction, playing a part in determining
the behaviour of the group, or rather of the individuals of which the
group is composed? For the actions of the group are merely the
sum of the actions of its individuals. If the former alternative be
adopted, then we may confidently say that the existence of a
&#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; must from the nature of the case remain
a mere speculation, incapable of verification; and that, if it does
exist, since it cannot make any difference, cannot in any way affect
human life and conduct, it is for us unreal, no matter how real it
may be for itself, as Espinas maintains; and we certainly are not
called upon to have any regard for it or its happiness, nor can we
invoke its aid in attempting to explain the course of history and
the phenomena of social life. If, on the other hand, the &#8216;collective
consciousness&#8217; of groups and societies and peoples reacts upon
individual minds and so plays a part in shaping the conduct of men
and societies, then the conception is a hypothesis which can only
be justified by showing that it affords explanations of social phenomena
which in its absence remain inexplicable. If it were found that
social aggregates of any kind really do exhibit, as has often been
maintained, great mass-movements, emigrations, religious or political
uprisings, and so forth, for which no adequate explanations can be
found in the mental processes of individuals and the mental interactions
of individuals by the ordinary means of expression and
perception, a resort to some such hypothesis would be permissible;
but it is an offence against the principles of scientific method to
invoke its aid, before we have exhausted the possibilities of explanation
offered by well-known existents and forces. That certainly has
not yet been done, and the upholders of the doctrine have hardly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
made any attempt to justify it in this the only possible manner in
which it could be justified. The only evidence of this sort adduced
by Espinas is the rapid spread of a common emotion and impulse
throughout the members of animal and human groups; and of
such phenomenon we have already found a sufficient explanation in
those special adaptations of the instincts of all gregarious creatures
which are unmistakably implied by the way in which the expression
of an emotion directly evokes a display of the same
emotion in any onlooking member of the species.</p>

<p>We may, then, set aside the conception of a &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217;
as a hypothesis to be held in reserve until the study of group
life reveal phenomena that cannot be explained without its aid.
For it may be confidently asserted that up to the present time
no such evidence of a &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; has been brought
forward, and that there is no possibility of any such evidence being
obtained before the principles of social psychology have been
applied far more thoroughly than has yet been done to the explanation
of the course of history. In adopting a so far unsympathetic
attitude towards this doctrine, we ought to admit that, if there be
any truth in it, the &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; of even the most highly
organised society may be still in a rudimentary stage, and that it may
continue to gain in effectiveness and organisation with the further
evolution of the society in question.</p>

<p>After this digression we may return to the consideration of the
emotional characteristics of simple crowds. We have to notice not
only that the emotions of crowds are apt to be excessively strong,
but also that certain types of emotion are more apt than others to
spread through a crowd, namely the coarser simpler emotions and
those which do not imply the existence of developed and refined
sentiments. For many of the individuals of most crowds will be
incapable of the more subtle complex emotions and will be devoid
of the more refined sentiments; while such sentiments as the individuals
possess will be in the main more diverse in proportion to
their refinement and special character; hence the chances of any
crowd being homogeneous as regards these emotions and sentiments
is small. Whereas the primary emotions and the coarser sentiments
may be common to all the members of a crowd; any crowd is likely
to be homogeneous in respect to them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a crowd is more apt to be swayed by the more
generous of the coarser emotions, impulses, and sentiments than by
those of a meaner universally reprobated kind. For each member of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the crowd acts in full publicity; and his knowledge of, and regard
for, public opinion will to some extent incline him to suppress the
manifestation of feelings which he might indulge in private but
would be ashamed of in public. Hence a crowd is more readily
carried away by admiration for a noble deed, or by moral indignation
against an act of cruelty, than by self-pity or jealousy or envy or
a meanly vengeful emotion.</p>

<p>At the same time, a crowd is apt to express feelings which imply
less consideration and regard for others than the individual, representing
the average morality and refinement of its members, would
display when not under the influence of the crowd. Thus men,
when members of a crowd, will witness with enjoyment scenes of
brutality and suffering which, under other circumstances, they would
turn away from, or would seek to terminate. To see a man thrown
heavily to the ground is not pleasing to most individuals; yet the
spectacle provokes roars of delight from the crowd at a football
match. How many of the spectators, who, as members of a crowd,
hugely enjoy looking on at a prize-fight or a bull-fight, would shrink
from witnessing it as isolated individuals! How many boys will join
with a crowd of others in cruelly teasing another boy, an animal,
an old woman, or a drunken man, who individually are incapable
of such &#8216;thoughtless&#8217; conduct! It may be doubted whether even
the depraved population of Imperial Rome could have individually
witnessed without aversion the destruction of Christians in the
Coliseum.</p>

<p>This character of crowds seems to be due to two peculiarities of
the collective mental state. In the first place, the individual, in
becoming one of a crowd, loses in some degree his self-consciousness,
his awareness of himself as a distinct personality, and with it goes
also something of his consciousness of his specifically personal relations;
he becomes to a certain extent depersonalised. In the second
place, and intimately connected with this last change, is a diminution
of the sense of personal responsibility: the individual feels himself
enveloped and overshadowed and carried away by forces which he is
powerless to control; he therefore does not feel called upon to
maintain the attitude of self-criticism and self-restraint which under
ordinary circumstances are habitual to him, his more refined ideals
of behaviour fail to assert themselves against the overwhelming
forces that envelope him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Intellectual Processes of Simple Crowds</span></h4>

<p>No fact has been more strongly insisted upon by writers on the
psychology of crowds than the low degree of intelligence implied by
their collective actions. Not only mobs or simple crowds, but such
bodies as juries, committees, corporations of all sorts, which are
partially organised groups, are notoriously liable to pass judgments,
to form decisions, to enact rules or laws, so obviously erroneous,
unwise, or defective that anyone, even the least intelligent member
of the group concerned, might have been expected to produce a
better result.</p>

<p>The principal ground of the low order of intelligence displayed
by simple crowds is that the ideas and reasonings which can be
collectively understood and accepted must be such as can be appreciated
by the lower order of minds among the crowd. These least
intelligent minds bring down the intelligence of the whole to their
own level. This is true in some degree even of crowds composed of
highly educated persons; for, as in the case of the emotions and
sentiments, the higher faculties are always more or less specialised
and differentiated in various ways through differences of nurture
and training; whereas the simpler intellectual faculties and tendencies
are common to all men.</p>

<p>A second condition, which co-operates with the foregoing to keep
the intellectual processes of crowds at a low level, is the increased
suggestibility of its members. Here is one of the most striking facts
of collective mental life. A crowd impresses each of its members
with a sense of its power, its unknown capacities, its unlimited and
mysterious possibilities; and these, as I have shown in Chapter III
of my <i>Social Psychology</i>, are the attributes that excite in us the
instinct of subjection and so throw us into the receptive suggestible
attitude towards the object that displays them. Mere numbers are
capable of exerting this effect upon most of us; but the effect of
numbers is greatly increased if all display a common emotion and
speak with one voice; the crowd has then, if we are in its presence,
a well nigh irresistible prestige. Hence even the highly intelligent
and self-reliant member of a crowd is apt to find his critical reserve
broken down; and, when an orator makes some proposition which
the mass of the crowd applauds but which each more intelligent
member would as an individual reject with scorn, it is apt to be
uncritically accepted by all alike; because it comes to each, not as
the proposition of the orator alone, but as a proposition which voices
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the mind of the crowd, which comes from the mass of men he
sees around him and so comes with the power of a mass-suggestion.</p>

<p>A further ground of the suggestibility of the crowd is that prevalence
of emotional excitement which was discussed in the foregoing
pages. It is well recognised that almost any emotional excitement
increases the suggestibility of the individual, though the
explanation of the fact remains obscure. I have suggested that the
explanation is to be found in the principle of the vicarious usage
of nervous energy, the principle that nervous energy, liberated in
any one part of the nervous system, may overflow the channels of
the system in which it is liberated and re-enforce processes initiated
in other systems. If this be true, we can see how any condition of
excitement will favour suggestibility; for it will re-enforce whatever
idea or impulse may have been awakened and made dominant by
&#8216;suggestion.&#8217; The principle requires perhaps the following limitation.
Emotion which is finding outlet in well-directed action is probably
unfavourable to all such &#8216;suggestions&#8217; as are not congruent with its
tendencies. It is vague emotion, or such as finds no appropriate
expression in action, that favours suggestibility. The most striking
illustrations of the greatly increased suggestibility of crowds are
afforded by well-authenticated instances of collective hallucination,
instances which, so long as we fail to take into account the abnormal
suggestibility of the members of crowds, seem utterly mysterious,
incredible, and super-normal.</p>

<p>Again, the capacity of crowds to arrive at correct conclusions by
any process of reasoning is apt to be diminished in another way by
the exaltation of emotion to which, as we have seen, they are
peculiarly liable. It is a familiar fact that correct observation and
reasoning are hampered by emotion; for all ideas congruent with the
prevailing emotion come far more readily to consciousness and persist
more stably than ideas incongruent with it, and conclusions congruent
with the prevailing emotion and desire are accepted readily
and uncritically; whereas those opposed to them can hardly find
acceptance in the minds of most men, no matter how simple and
convincing be the reasoning that leads to them.</p>

<p>The diminution or abolition of the sense of personal responsibility,
which results from membership in a crowd and which, as we have
seen, favours the display of its emotions, tends also to lower the
level of its intellectual processes. Wherever men have to come to a
collective decision or to undertake collective action of any sort, this
effect plays an important part. The weight of responsibility that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
would be felt by any one man, deciding or acting alone, is apt to
be divided among all the members of the group; so that for each
man it is diminished in proportion to the number of persons taking
part in the affair. Hence the attention and care devoted by each
man to the task of deliberation, observation, or execution, are less
keen and continuously sustained, and a judgment or decision is more
lightly and easily arrived at, grounds which the individual, deliberating
alone, would reject or weigh again and again serving to
determine an immediate judgment. The principle is well recognised
in practical life. We do not set ten men to keep the look-out on
ship-board, but only one; though the safety of the ship and of all
that it carries depends upon his unremitting alertness. We see the
principle recognised in the institution of the jury. But for the
weakening of the individual sense of responsibility, juries would
seldom be found capable of finding a prisoner guilty of murder and
so condemning him to death; while, by the restriction of the jury
to a comparatively small number, the worst features of collective
mental life are avoided.</p>

<p>We see the working of the principle not only in simple crowds,
but also in groups of very considerable degrees of organisation. We
see it in the way in which many a man, who would shrink from the
responsibility of directing a great and complicated commercial undertaking,
will cheerfully join a board of directors each of whom is
perhaps no better qualified than himself to conduct the business of
the concern. We may recognise its effects also in the cheerful levity,
not to say hilarity, that frequently pervades our House of Commons;
for most of its well-meaning members would be utterly crushed
under the weight of their legislative responsibility, were it not
divided in small fractions among them.</p>

<p>But the low sense of responsibility of the crowd is not due to the
division of responsibility alone. In the case of the simple crowd, it is
due also in large part to the fact that such a crowd has but a very
low grade of self-consciousness and no self-regarding sentiment; that
is to say, the members of the crowd have but a dim consciousness of
the crowd as a whole, but very little knowledge of its tendencies
and capacities, and no sentiment of love, respect, or regard of any
kind for it and its reputation in the eyes of men. Hence, since the
responsibility falls on the whole crowd, and any loss or gain of
reputation affects the crowd and hardly at all the individuals who
are merged in it, they are not stimulated to exert care and self-restraint
and critical deliberation in forming their judgments, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
arriving at decisions, or in executing any task collectively undertaken.
The results of these two conditions of collective mental life
are well summed up in the popular dictum that a corporation has
no conscience.</p>

<p>Since all these factors co-operate to keep the intellectual activity
of the simple crowd on a low level, it follows that very simple
intellectual processes must be relied on by the orator who would
sway a crowd; he must rely on abuse and ridicule of opponents, or
unmeasured praise of friends; on flattery; on the <i>argumentum ad
hominem</i>; on induction by simple enumeration of a few striking
instances; on obvious and superficial analogies; on the evocation of
vivid representative imagery rather than of abstract ideas; and,
above all, on confident assertion and reiteration, and on a display
of the coarser emotions.</p>

<p>Since the individuals comprised in a crowd are apt to be influenced
in all these ways by the mass of their fellows, it follows that
the mental processes, the thoughts and feelings and actions, of each
one will be as a rule very different from what they would be if he
faced a similar situation as an isolated individual; the mental processes
of each one are profoundly modified by his mental interactions
with all the other members of the crowd. Therefore the collective
actions of a crowd are not simply the resultants of all the tendencies
to thought and action of the individuals, as such, but may be very
different from any such resultant. And they are not merely the
expression of the individual tendencies of the average member, nor
yet of the mass of least intelligent and refined members; they may
be, and often are, such as no one of the members acting alone would
ever display or attempt.</p>

<p>It must be added that all the peculiarities of collective mental
process mentioned above express themselves very readily in the
actions of simple crowds, because such a crowd is incapable of
resolution and volition in the true sense of the words. I have
shown<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> that individual resolution and volition are only rendered
possible by the possession of a well-developed self-consciousness and
self-regarding sentiment. But a simple crowd has at the most only a
rudimentary self-consciousness and has no self-regarding sentiment.
Hence its actions are the direct issue of the various impulses that
are collectively evoked; and, though it may be collectively conscious
of the end towards which it is impelled, and though all the individuals
may desire to effect or realise this end, and to that extent may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
said to be capable of purpose; yet such an impulse or desire cannot
be steadied, strengthened, renewed, or supported and maintained, in
opposition to any other impulse that may come into play, by an
impulse springing from the self-regarding sentiment in the way
which constitutes resolution and volition. Just so far as the self-regarding
sentiment of individuals comes into play and they exert
their individual volitions, they cease to act as members of a crowd.
The actions of the simple crowd are thus not the outcome of a general
will, nor are they the resultant of the wills of all its members; they
are simply not volitional in the true sense, but rather impulsive.
They are comparable with the actions of an animal rather than with
those of a man. It is the lack of the conditions necessary to collective
resolution and volition that renders a crowd so fickle and inconsistent;
so capable of passing from one extreme of action to another,
of hurrying to death the man whom it glorified at an earlier moment,
or of turning from savage butchery to tender and tearful solicitude.
Such incapacity of the crowd for resolution and volition, together
with the increased suggestibility of its members, accounts for the
fact that a crowd may be easily induced to follow as a leader any
one who, by means of the elementary reasoning processes suited to
its intellectual capacity, can succeed in suggesting to it the desirability
of any course of action.</p>

<p>We may sum up the psychological characters of the unorganised
or simple crowd by saying that it is excessively emotional, impulsive,
violent, fickle, inconsistent, irresolute and extreme in action, displaying
only the coarser emotions and the less refined sentiments;
extremely suggestible, careless in deliberation, hasty in judgment,
incapable of any but the simpler and imperfect forms of reasoning;
easily swayed and led, lacking in self-consciousness, devoid of self-respect
and of sense of responsibility, and apt to be carried away
by the consciousness of its own force, so that it tends to produce
all the manifestations we have learnt to expect of any irresponsible
and absolute power. Hence its behaviour is like that of an unruly
child or an untutored passionate savage in a strange situation, rather
than like that of its average member; and in the worst cases
it is like that of a wild beast, rather than like that of human
beings.</p>

<p>All these characteristics of the crowd were exemplified on a great
scale in Paris at the time of the great revolution, when masses of
men that were little more than unorganised crowds escaped from all
control and exerted supreme power; and writers on the topic have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
drawn many striking illustrations from the history of the days of the
Terror<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. The understanding of these more elementary facts and
principles of group psychology will prevent us falling into such an
error as was committed by our greatest political philosopher, Edmund
Burke, when he condemned the French people in the most violent
terms on account of the terrible events of the Revolution; for he
attributed to the inhabitants of France in general, as individuals, the
capacities for violence and brutality and the gross defects of intelligence
and self-restraint that were displayed by the Parisian crowds
of the time; whereas the study of collective psychology has led us
to see that the actions of a crowd afford no measure of the moral and
intellectual status of the individuals of which it is composed. So,
when we hear of minor outrages committed by a crowd of undergraduates
or suffragettes, a knowledge of group psychology will save
us from the error of attributing to the individuals concerned the low
grade of intelligence and decency that might seem to be implied by
the deeds performed by them collectively. The same understanding
will also resolve for us some seeming paradoxes; for example, the
paradox that, while in the year 1906 the newspapers contained many
reports of almost incredible brutalities committed by the peasants
in many different parts of Russia, an able correspondent, who was
studying the peasants at that very time, ascribed to them, as the
most striking quality of their characters, an exceptional humaneness
and kindliness<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>It will be maintained on a later page that we may properly speak
not only of a collective will, but also of the collective mind of an
organised group, for example, of the mind and will of a nation. We
must, then, ask at this stage&mdash;Can we properly speak of the collective
mind of an unorganised crowd? The question is merely one as to
the proper use of words and therefore not of the first importance.
If we had found reason to accept the hypothesis of a &#8216;collective
consciousness&#8217; of a group, and to believe that the peculiarities of
behaviour of a crowd are due to a &#8216;collective consciousness,&#8217; then we
should certainly have to admit the propriety of regarding the crowd
as having a collective mind. But we have provisionally rejected that
hypothesis, and have maintained that the only consciousness of a
crowd or other group is the consciousnesses of its constituent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
individuals. In the absence of any &#8216;collective consciousness&#8217; we may
still speak of collective minds; for we have defined a mind as an
organised system of interacting mental or psychical forces. This
definition, while allowing us to speak of the collective mind of such
a group as a well-developed nation, hardly allows us to attribute
such a mind to a simple crowd: for the interplay of its mental forces
is not determined by the existence of an organised system of relations
between the elements in which the forces are generated; and such
determination is an essential feature of whatever can be called a
mind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>THE HIGHLY ORGANISED GROUP</h4>

<p>The peculiarities of simple crowds tend to appear in all group life;
but they are modified in proportion as the group is removed in
character from a simple crowd, a fortuitous congregation of men
of more or less similar tendencies and sentiments. Many crowds are
not fortuitous gatherings, but are brought together by the common
interest of their members in some object or topic. These may differ
from the simple fortuitous crowd only in being more homogeneous
as regards the sentiments and interests of their members; their
greater homogeneity does not in itself raise them above the mental
level of the fortuitous crowd; it merely intensifies the peculiarities
of group life, especially as regards the intensity of the collective
emotion.</p>

<p>There is, however, one condition that may raise the behaviour of
a temporary and unorganised crowd to a higher plane, namely the
presence of a clearly defined common purpose in the minds of all its
members. Such a crowd, for example a crowd of white men in one
of the Southern States of North America setting out to lynch a negro
who is supposed to have committed some flagrant crime, will display
most of the characteristics of the common crowd, the violence and
brutality of emotion and impulse, the lack of restraint, the diminished
sense of responsibility, the increased suggestibility and incapacity
for arriving at correct conclusions by deliberation and the weighing
of evidence. But it will not exhibit the fickleness of a common crowd,
the easy yielding to distracting impressions and to suggestions that
are opposed to the common purpose. Such a crowd may seize and
execute its victim with inflexible determination, perhaps with a
brutality and a ruthless disregard of all deterrent considerations of
which no one of its members would be individually capable; and
may then at once break up, each man returning quietly and seriously
to his home, in a way which has often been described by witnesses
astonished at the contrast between the behaviour of the crowd and
that of the individuals into which it suddenly resolves itself.</p>

<p>The behaviour of a crowd of this kind raises the problem of the
general or collective will. It was said in the foregoing chapter that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the actions of a common crowd cannot properly be regarded as
volitional, because they are the immediate outcome of the primary
impulses. Yet the actions of a crowd of the kind we are now considering
are the issue of true resolutions formed by each member
of the crowd, and are, therefore, truly volitional. Nevertheless, they
are the expression not of a general or collective will, but merely of
the wills of all the individuals; and, even if there arise differences
between the members and a conflict of wills as to the mode of
achieving the common end, and if the issue be determined simply
by the stronger party overbearing the weaker and securing their
co-operation, that still does not constitute the expression of a general
will. For a collective or general will only exists where some idea
of the whole group and some sentiment for it as such exists in the
minds of the persons composing it. But we may with advantage
examine the nature of collective volition on a later page, in relation
to the life of a highly organised group, such as an army.</p>

<p>There are five conditions of principal importance in raising
collective mental life to a higher level than the unorganised crowd
can reach, no matter how homogeneous the crowd may be in ideas and
sentiments nor how convergent the desires and volitions of its
members. These are the principal conditions which favour and render
possible the formation of a group mind, in addition to those more
fundamental conditions of collective life which we have noted in the
foregoing chapter.</p>

<p>The first of these conditions, which is the basis of all the rest, is
some degree of continuity of existence of the group. The continuity
may be predominantly material or formal; that is to say, it may
consist either in the persistence of the same individuals as an intercommunicating
group, or in the persistence of the system of generally
recognised positions each of which is occupied by a succession of
individuals. Most permanent groups exhibit both forms of continuity
in a certain degree; for, the material continuity of a group being
given, some degree of formal continuity will commonly be established
within it. The most highly organised groups, such as well-developed
nations, exhibit both forms in the highest degree.</p>

<p>A second very important condition, essential to any highly
developed form of collective life, is that in the minds of the mass
of the members of the group there shall be formed some adequate
idea of the group, of its nature, composition, functions, and capacities,
and of the relations of the individuals to the group. The diffusion
of this idea among the members of the group, which constitutes the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
self-consciousness of the group mind, would be of little effect or
importance, if it were not that, as with the idea of the individual
self, a sentiment of some kind almost inevitably becomes organised
about this idea and is the main condition of its growth in richness
of meaning; a sentiment for the group which becomes the source
of emotions and of impulses to action having for their objects the
group and its relations to other groups.</p>

<p>A third condition very favourable to the development of the
collective mind of a group, though not perhaps absolutely essential,
is the interaction (especially in the form of conflict and rivalry) of
the group with other similar groups animated by different ideals and
purposes, and swayed by different traditions and customs. The
importance of such interaction of groups lies chiefly in the fact that it
greatly promotes the self-knowledge and self-sentiment of each group.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the existence of a body of traditions and customs and
habits in the minds of the members of the group determining their
relations to one another and to the group as a whole.</p>

<p>Lastly, organisation of the group, consisting in the differentiation
and specialisation of the functions of its constituents&mdash;the individuals
and classes or groups of individuals within the group. This
organisation may rest wholly or in part upon the conditions of the
fourth class, traditions, customs, and habits. But it may be in part
imposed on the group and maintained by the authority of some
external power.</p>

<p>The capacity for collective life of an organised group whose
organisation is imposed upon it and wholly maintained by an external
authority is but little superior to that of a simple crowd. Such a
group will differ from the simple crowd chiefly in exhibiting greater
control of its impulses and a greater continuity of direction of its
activities; but these qualities are due to the external compelling
power and are not truly the expression of its collective mental life.
An army of slaves or, in a less complete degree, an army of mercenaries
is the type of this kind of organised group; and a people
ruled by a strong despot relying on a mercenary or foreign army
approximates to it. The first aim of the power that would maintain
such an organisation must always be to prevent and suppress collective
life, by forbidding gatherings and public discussions, by rendering
communications between the parts difficult, and by enforcing a rigid
discipline. For such an organisation is essentially unstable.</p>

<p>We may illustrate the influence of these five conditions by considering
how in a group of relatively simple kind, in which they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
all present, they favour collective life and raise it to a higher level
of efficiency. Such a group is a patriot army fighting in a cause that
elicits the enthusiasm of its members; such were the armies of
Japan in the late Russo-Japanese war; they exhibited in a high
degree and in relative simplicity the operation of all the conditions
we have enumerated.</p>

<p>Such an army exhibits the exaltation of emotion common to all
psychological crowds. This intensification of emotion enables men
to face danger and certain death with enthusiasm, and on other
occasions may, even in the armies of undoubtedly courageous and
warlike nations, result in panic and a rout. But in all other respects
the characteristics of the simple crowd are profoundly modified.
The formal continuity of the existence of the army and of its several
units secures for it, even though its personnel be changed at a rapid
rate, a past and therefore a tradition, a self-consciousness and a
self-regarding sentiment, a pride in its past and a tradition of high
conduct and achievement; for past failures are discreetly forgotten
and only its past successes and glories are kept in memory. The
traditional group consciousness and sentiment are fostered by every
wise commander, both in the army as a whole and in each separate
department and regiment. Is not the superiority in battle of such
bodies as the famous Tenth Legion due as much to such self-conscious
tradition and sentiment as to the presence of veterans in its ranks?
And is not the same true of such regiments as the Black Watch, the
Gordons, the Grenadier Guards, and the other famous regiments
of the British army?</p>

<p>The third of the conditions mentioned above is also very obviously
present in the case of an army in the field&mdash;namely, interaction
with a similar group having different purposes, traditions, and
sentiments. And in this case the interaction, being of the nature of
direct competition and conflict, is of the kind most favourable to
the development of the collective mind. It accentuates the self-consciousness
of the whole; that is to say, it defines more clearly
in the mind of each individual the whole of which he is a part, his
position in, his organic connexion with, and his dependence upon,
the whole; with each succeeding stage of the conflict he conceives
the whole more clearly, obtains a fuller knowledge of the capacities
and weaknesses of the whole and its parts. Each soldier learns, too,
something of the character of the opposing army; and, in the light
of this knowledge, his conception of his own army becomes better
defined and richer in meaning. In short, through interaction with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
opposing army, the army as a whole becomes more clearly reflected
in the mind of each of its members, its self-consciousness is clarified
and enriched. In a similar way, intercourse and rivalry between the
various regiments greatly promotes the growth of the self-knowledge
and self-sentiment of each of these lesser groups. A standing army
inevitably possesses a wealth of traditions, habits and customs, over
and above its formal organisation, and these play an important
part in promoting the smooth working of the whole organism; the
lack of these is one of the chief difficulties in the way of the creation
of a new army, as was vividly illustrated in the making of the
&#8216;Kitchener army&#8217; during the Great War. The customs of the various
officers&#8217; messes were but a small part of this mass of custom which
does so much to bind the whole army together.</p>

<p>An army obviously possesses organisation, generally in a very
high degree. The formal continuity of its existence enables the
organisation impressed upon it by external authority to acquire all
the strength that custom alone can give; while its material continuity
enables its organisation to generate, in the individual soldiers, habits
through which the inferior members are raised, as regards the moral
qualities required for efficiency in the field, towards the level of the
best.</p>

<p>The organisation of the whole army has two aspects and two
main functions; the one is executive, the securing of the co-ordination
of action of the parts in the carrying out of the common plan; the
other is recipient and deliberative, the co-ordination of the data
supplied by the parts through deliberation upon which the choice
of means is arrived at. Deliberation and choice of means are
carried out by the commander-in-chief and his staff, the persons who
have shown themselves best able to execute this part of the army&#8217;s
task. It is important to note that, in the case of such an army as
we are considering, the private soldier in the ranks remains a free
agent performing truly volitional actions; that he in no sense becomes
a mechanical agent or one acting through enforced or habitual
obedience merely. He wills the common end; and, believing that the
choice of means to that end is best effected by the appropriate part
of the whole organisation, he accepts the means chosen, makes of
them his proximate end, and wills them.</p>

<p>This is the essential character of the effective organisation of any
human group; it secures that while the common end of collective
action is willed by all, the choice of means is left to those best
qualified and in the best position for deliberation and choice; and it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
secures that co-ordination of the voluntary actions of the parts which
brings about the common end by the means so chosen. In this way
the collective actions of the well-organised group, instead of being,
like those of the simple crowd, merely impulsive or instinctive
actions, implying a degree of intelligence and of morality far inferior
to that of the average individual of the crowd, become truly volitional
actions expressive of a degree of intelligence and morality much
higher than that of the average member of the group: i.e. the
whole is raised above the level of its average member; and even, by
reason of exaltation of emotion and organised co-operation in deliberation,
above that of its highest members.</p>

<p>Here we must consider a little more fully the nature of the
collective or general will, a subject that has figured largely in the
discussions of political philosophers on the nature of the State.
Rousseau wrote&mdash;&#8220;There is often a great difference between the will
of all and the general will; the latter looks only to the common
interest; the former looks to private interest, and is nothing but a
series of individual wills; but take away from these same wills the
plus and minus that cancel one another and there remains, as the
sum of the differences, the general will.&#8221; &#8220;Sovereignty is only the
exercise of the general will.&#8221; By this he seems to mean that a certain
number of men will the general good, while many will only their
private goods; and that while the latter neutralise one another, as
regards their effects on the general interest, the former co-operate
and so form an effective force to promote the general good. This
doctrine was an approximation towards the truth, though like all
Rousseau&#8217;s social speculations, his handling of it was vitiated by
his false psychology, which set out from the fiction of man as an
independent purely self-contained and self-determining absolute
individual. Later writers do not seem to have improved upon
Rousseau&#8217;s doctrine of the general will to any great extent.</p>

<p>The problem of the general will, like all problems of collective
psychology, becomes extremely complex when we consider the life
of nations; and it is, therefore, important to make ourselves clear as
to the nature of collective volition by consideration of the relatively
simple case of a patriot army. It is of course impossible to arrive at
a clear notion of collective volition, until individual volition has been
clearly defined and the nature of the distinction between it, on the
one hand, and mere impulsive action, desire, and simple conflict of
desires, on the other hand, has been made clear. The lack of such
clear notions and adequate definitions has rendered much of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
discussion of this topic by political philosophers sterile and obscure.
In the light of the conclusions reached in my chapter on individual
volition<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, the question of the nature of collective volition presents
little difficulty. It was found that volition may be defined and
adequately marked off from the simpler modes of conation by saying
that it is the reinforcement of any impulse or conation by one excited
within the system of the self-regarding sentiment. And in an earlier
chapter<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> it was shewn how the self-regarding sentiment may become
extended to other objects than the individual self, to all objects with
which the self identifies itself, which are regarded as belonging to
the self or as part of the wider self. This extension depends largely
on the fact that others identify us with such an object, so that we
feel ourselves to be an object of all the regards and attitudes and
actions of others directed towards that object, and are emotionally
affected by them in the same ways that we are affected by similar
regards, attitudes, and actions directed towards us individually. It
was shewn also that such a sentiment may become wider and
emotionally richer than the purely self-regarding sentiment, through
fusing with a sentiment of love for the object that has grown up
independently. These facts were illustrated by consideration of the
parental sentiment for the child, which, it was said, has commonly
this twofold character and source, being formed by the compounding
of the self-regarding sentiment with the sentiment of love of which
the dominant disposition is that of the tender or protective instinct.</p>

<p>In a similar way a similarly complex sentiment may become
organised about the idea of one&#8217;s family, or of any still larger group
having continuity of existence of which one becomes a member. In
the case of the patriot&#8217;s sentiment for his country or nation, the
self-regarding sentiment and the sentiment of love may be from the
first combined in the patriotic sentiment; since he knows himself to
be a part of the whole from the time that an idea of the whole first
takes shape in his mind.</p>

<p>In this respect the case of the soldier in a patriot army is
relatively simple. As a boy he may have acquired a sentiment of
loving admiration for the army; and, when he becomes a member
of it, the dispositions that enter into the constitution of his self-regarding
sentiment, become incorporated with this previously
existing sentiment, so that the reputation of the army becomes as
important to him as his own; praise and approval of it become for
him objects of desire and sources of elation; disapproval and blame
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of it, or the prospect of them, affect him as painfully as if directed
to himself individually, fill him with shame and mortification.</p>

<p>A similar complex sentiment, the sentiment of patriotism, becomes
organised about the idea of his country as a whole; and, when
war breaks out and the army is pitted against that of another nation,
while the eyes of the whole world are turned upon it, it becomes
the representative of the nation and the special object of the
patriotic sentiment, which thus adds its strength to that of the more
special sentiment of the soldier for the army<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. When, then, the
patriot army takes the field, it is capable of collective volition in
virtue of the existence of this sentiment in the minds of all its
members. The soldiers of a purely mercenary army are moved by
the desire of individual glory, of increased pay, of loot, by the habit
of obedience and collective movement acquired by prolonged drilling,
by the pugnacious impulse, by the desire of self-preservation; and
they may be led on to greater exertions by the influence of an
admired captain. But such an army is incapable of collective volition,
because no sentiment for the army as a whole is common to all its
members. The soldiers of the patriot army on the other hand may
act from all the individual motives enumerated above; but all alike
are capable also of being stirred by a common motive, a desire
excited within the collective self-regarding sentiment, the common
sentiment for the army; and this, adding itself to whatever individual
motives are operative, converts their desires into collective resolutions
and renders their actions the expressions of a collective volition.</p>

<p>Each soldier of the mercenary army may desire that his side
shall win the battle and may resolve that he will do his best to bring
victory to his side, and he may perform many truly volitional actions;
and, in so far as the actions of the army express these individual
volitions towards a common result, they are the expressions of the
&#8216;will of all,&#8217; but not of the collective will; because these volitions,
though they are directed to the one common end, spring from diverse
motives and are individual volitions.</p>

<p>The essence of collective volition is, then, not merely the direction
of the wills of all to the same end, but the motivation of the wills
of all members of a group by impulses awakened within the common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
sentiment for the whole of which they are the parts. It is the
extension of the self-regarding sentiment of each member of the
group to the group as a whole that binds the group together and
renders it a collective individual capable of collective volition.</p>

<p>The facts may be illustrated more concretely by taking a still
simpler example of collective volition. Consider the case of a regiment
in battle commanded to occupy a certain hill-top in face of
fierce opposition. If the regiment is one to which the self-regarding
sentiment of each member has become extended, the soldiers may
be animated individually by the pugnacious impulse and by the
desire of individual glory, but they are moved also by the common
desire to show what the regiment can do, to sustain its glorious
reputation; they resolve that we, the regiment, will accomplish this
feat. As they charge up the hill, the hail of bullets decimates their
ranks and they waver, the impulse of fear checking their onward
rush; if then their officer appeals to the common sentiment, each
man feels the answering impulse; and this is strengthened by the cheer
which shows him that the same impulse rises in all his comrades;
and so this impulse, awakened within the collective self-regarding
sentiment and strengthened by sympathetic induction from all to
each, comes to the support of the pugnacious impulse or whatever
other motives sustain each man, enables these to triumph over the
impulse to flight, and sweeps them all on to gain their object by truly
collective volitional effort. If, on the other hand, the men of the
regiment have no such common sentiment, then, when the advancing
line wavers, the onward impulsion checked by the impulse of retreat,
there is no possibility of arousing a collective volition; the regiment,
which from the first was a crowd organised only by external authority
and the habits created by it, acts as a crowd and yields to the rising
impulse of the emotion of fear, which, becoming intensified by induction
from man to man, rises to a panic; and the regiment is routed.</p>

<p>We may distinguish, then, five modes of conation which will
carry all the members of a group towards a common object, five
levels of collective action.</p>

<p>Let the group be a body of men on a road leading across a
wilderness to a certain walled city. A sudden threat of danger from
a band of robbers or from wild beasts may send them all flying in
panic towards the city gate. That is a purely impulsive collective
action. It is not merely a sum of individual actions, because the
fear and, therefore, the impulse to flight of each man is intensified by
the influence of his fellows.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, let them be a band of pilgrims, fortuitously congregated,
each of whom has resolved to reach the city for his own
private purposes. The whole body moves on steadily, each perhaps
aided in maintaining his resolution in face of difficulties by the
presence of the rest and the spectacle of their resolute efforts. Here
there is a certain collectivity of action, the individual wills are
strengthened by the community of purpose. But the arrival of the
band is not due to collective volition; nor can it properly be said
to be due to the will of all; for each member cares nothing for the
arrival of the band as a whole; he desires and wills only his own arrival.</p>

<p>Thirdly, let each member of the band be aware that, at any point
of the road, robbers may oppose the passage of any individual or
of any company not sufficiently strong to force its way through.
Each member will then desire that the whole band shall cohere and
shall reach the city, and the actions of the group will display a higher
degree of co-operation and collective efficiency than in the former
cases; but the successful passage of the band will be desired by each
member simply in order that his own safe arrival may be secured.
There is direction of all wills towards the production of the one result,
the success of the whole band; but this is not truly collective volition
because the motives are private and individual and diverse.</p>

<p>Fourthly, let the band be an army of crusaders, a motley throng
of heterogeneous elements of various nationalities, united by one
common purpose, the capture of the city, but having no sentiment
for the army. In this case all members not only will the same
collective action and desire the same end of that action, but they
have similar motives arising from their sentiment for the city or
that which it contains. Still their combined actions are not the issue
of a collective volition in the full and proper sense of the words, but
of a coincidental conjunction of individual volitions. They might
perhaps be said to be the expression of the general will; and by
giving that meaning to the term &#8216;general will,&#8217; while reserving the
expression collective will or volition for the type of case illustrated
by our next instance, we may usefully differentiate the two expressions.</p>

<p>Lastly, let the band approaching the city be an army of crusaders
of one nationality, and let us suppose that this army has enjoyed a
considerable continuity of existence and that in the mind of each
member the self-regarding sentiment has become extended to the
army as a whole, so that, as we say, each one identifies himself with
it and prizes its reputation and desires its success as an end in itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Such a sentiment would be greatly developed and strengthened by
rivalry in deeds of arms with a second crusading army. Each member
of this army would have the same motives for capturing the city as
those of the army of our last instance; but, in addition to these
motives, there would be awakened within the extended self-regarding
sentiment of each man an impulse to assert the power, to sustain
the glory of the army; and this, adding its force to those other
motives, would enable them to triumph over all conflicting tendencies
and render the resolution of the army to capture the city a true
collective volition; so that the army might properly be said to possess
and to exercise a general or collective will.</p>

<p>This distinction between the will of all and the collective will,
which we have considered at some length, may seem to be of slight
importance in the instances chosen. But it becomes of the greatest
importance when we have to consider the life of a nation or other
enduring community. The power of truly collective volition is no
small advantage to any body of fighting men and receives practical
recognition from experienced captains.</p>

<p>The importance of these different types of volition was abundantly
illustrated by the incidents of the Boer war and of the Russo-Japanese
war. That the success of its undertaking shall be strongly
willed by all is perhaps the most important factor contributing to
the success of an army; and if also the army exercises a true collective
volition, in the sense defined above, it becomes irresistible. Though
it is questionable whether the Boer armies can be said to have
exercised a collective volition, it is at least certain that individually
the Boers strongly willed their common end, the defeat of the
British. On the other hand, the British armies were defective in
these respects. The motives of those who fought in the British
armies against the Boers were very diverse. The pay of the regulars,
the five shillings a day of the volunteers, the desire to live for a
time an adventurous exciting life, the desire to get home again
on the sick-list as soon as possible, the desire for personal distinction;
all these and other motives were in many minds mixed in
various proportions with the desire to assert the supremacy of the
British rule and support the honour of the flag. This difference
between the Boer and British armies was undoubtedly a main cause
of many of the surprising successes of the former. In the Russo-Japanese
war the opposed armies probably differed even more widely
in this respect. The Japanese soldiers not only willed intensely the
common end, but their armies would appear to have exercised truly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
collective volition. Many of the several regiments also, being recruited
on the territorial system, were animated by collective sentiments
rooted in local patriotism. The Russian armies on the other
hand were largely composed of peasants drawn from widely separated
regions of the Russian empire, knowing little or nothing of the
grounds of quarrel or of the ends to be achieved by their efforts,
caring nothing individually for those ends, and having but little
patriotic sentiment and still less sentiment for the army.</p>

<p>It would, then, be a grave mistake to infer from the course of
events in these two wars that the British soldier was individually
inferior to the Boer, or the Russian to the Japanese; in both cases
the principal psychological condition of successful collective action&mdash;namely,
a common end intensely desired and strongly willed, individually
or collectively&mdash;was present in high degree on the one side,
because the preservation of the national existence was the end in
view; while it was lacking or comparatively deficient on the other
side. As Sir Ian Hamilton, a close observer of both these wars, has
said&mdash;&#8220;the army that will not surrender under any circumstances will
always vanquish the army whose units are prepared to do so under
sufficient pressure.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same considerations afford an explanation of a peculiarity
of Russian armies which has often been noted in previous wars, and
which was very conspicuous in the late wars; namely, their weakness
in attack and their great strength when on the defensive. For, in
attacking, a Russian army is in the main merely obeying the will of
the commander-in-chief in virtue of custom, habit, and a form of
strong collective suggestion; but in retreat and on the defensive,
each man&#8217;s action becomes truly volitional, all are animated by a
common purpose, and all will the same end, the safety of the whole
with which that of each member is bound up.</p>

<p>The psychology of a patriot army is peculiarly simplified, as compared
with that of most other large human groups, by two conditions;
on the one hand, the restriction of the intellectual processes, by which
the large means for the pursuit of the common end are chosen, to
one or a few minds only; on the other hand, the definiteness and
singleness of its purpose and the presence of this clear and strong
purpose in the minds of all.</p>

<p>Other groups that enjoy in some degree the latter condition of
simplicity of collective mental life are associations voluntarily formed
and organised for the attainment of some single well-defined end.
In them the former condition is generally completely lacking and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the deliberative processes, by which their means are chosen, are apt
to be very complex and ineffective, owing to lack of customary
organisation. Such associations illustrate more clearly than any
other groups the part played by the idea of the whole in the minds
of the individuals in constituting and maintaining the whole. A
desire or purpose being present in many minds, the idea of the
association arises in some one or more of them, and, being communicated
to others, becomes the immediate instrument through
which the association is called into being; and only so long as this
idea of the whole as an instrument for attaining the common end
persists in the minds of the individuals does the association continue
to exist. In this respect such an association is at the opposite end
of the scale from the fortuitous crowd, which owes its existence to the
accidents of time and place merely. Human groups of other kinds
owe their existence in various proportions to these two conditions;
such groups, for example, as are constituted by the members of a
church, of a university or a school, of a profession or a township.
Others, such as nations, owe their inception to the accidents of
time and place, to physical boundaries and climatic conditions; and,
in the course of their evolution, become more and more dependent for
their existence on the idea of the whole and the sentiment organised
about it in the minds of their members; and they may, like the
Jewish people, arrive in the course of time at complete dependence
on the latter condition.</p>

<p>The life of an army illustrates better than that of any other
group the influence of leadership. That great strategists and skilful
tacticians perform intellectual services of immeasurable importance
for the common end of the army goes without saying. But the moral
influence of leadership is more subtle in its workings, and is perhaps
less generally recognised in all its complexity and scope. It is well
known that such commanders as Napoleon inspired unlimited confidence
and enthusiasm in the veteran armies that had made many
campaigns under their leadership. Yet in the Great War, in which
the British armies were, in its later stages, composed so largely of
new recruits, the same influence was perceptible. Both the British
and the French armies were very fortunate in having in supreme
command men in whom the common soldier felt confidence. The
solidity, the justice, the calm resolution of Marshal Joffre were felt
throughout the French army in the early days of the war to be the
one certain and fixed point in a crumbling universe. &#8220;Il est solid,
le P&egrave;re Joffre&#8221; was repeated by thousands who, remembering the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
disaster of 1870, were inclined to suspect treachery and weakness
on every hand. And the genius of Marshal Foch and of other brilliant
generals was a main source of the astonishing dogged resolution with
which the French armies, in spite of their terrible losses, sustained
the prolonged agony. The British army also was fortunate in having
in Field-Marshal Haig a man at its head who was felt to be above
all things resolute and calm and just; and, when the British armies
in France were placed under the supreme control of Foch, it was
generally felt throughout the ranks that this would not only give
unity of control and purpose, but also supply that touch of genius
which perhaps had been lacking in British strategy.</p>

<p>But it was not only the supreme command that exercised this
influence over the minds of all ranks. At every level confidence in
the leadership was of supreme importance. The character and talents
of each general and colonel, of each captain, lieutenant, sergeant and
corporal, made themselves felt by all under their control; felt not only
individually but corporately and collectively. The whole area under
the command of any particular general might be seen to reflect and to
express in some degree his attributes. The reputations of the higher
officers filtered down through the ranks in an astonishingly rapid
and accurate manner; perhaps owing largely to the fact that these
armies, in a degree unknown before, were composed of men accustomed
to read and to think and to discuss and criticise the conduct
of affairs. If the German higher command had been exercised from
the first by a man who inspired the just confidence that was felt in
the old Field-Marshal v. Moltke by the Prussian armies of 1870, it
is probable that the issue of the Great War would have been fatally
different.</p>

<p>The moral effects of good leadership are, perhaps, of more
importance to an army than its intellectual qualities, especially in
a prolonged struggle; and these work throughout the mass of men
by subtle processes of suggestion and emotional contagion rather
than by any process of purely intellectual appreciation. And the
whole organisation of any wisely directed army is designed to render
as effective as possible these processes by which the influence of
leaders is diffused through the whole.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>THE GROUP SPIRIT</h4>

<p>In considering the mental life of a patriot army, as the type of a
highly organised group, we saw that <i>group self-consciousness</i> is a
factor of very great importance&mdash;that it is a principal condition of
the elevation of its collective mental life and behaviour above the
level of the merely impulsive violence and unreasoning fickleness
of the mob.</p>

<p>This self-consciousness of the group is the essential condition of
all higher group life; we must therefore study it more nearly as it
is manifested in groups of various types. It is unfortunate that our
language has no word that accurately translates the French expression
&#8216;esprit de corps&#8217;; for this conveys exactly the conception
that we are examining. I propose to use the term group spirit as
the equivalent of the French expression, the frequent use of which
in English speech and writing sufficiently justifies the attempt to
specialise this compound word for psychological purposes.</p>

<p>We have seen that, in virtue of the sentiment developed about
the idea of the army, all its members exhibit <i>group loyalty</i>; it is only
as the sentiment develops about the idea that this idea of the whole,
present to the mind of each member, becomes a power which can
hold the whole group together, in spite of all physical and moral
difficulties. We see this if we reflect how armies of mercenaries, in
which this collective sentiment is lacking or rudimentary only,
are apt to dissolve and fade away by desertion as soon as serious
difficulties are encountered.</p>

<p>The importance of the collective idea and sentiment appears still
more clearly, when we reflect on the type of army which has generally
proved the most efficient of all&mdash;namely, an army of volunteers banded
together to achieve some particular end. Such an army (for example
the army of Garibaldi) owes its existence to the operation of this idea
in the minds of all. The idea of the army is formed in the mind
perhaps of one only (Garibaldi); he communicates it to others, who
accept it as a means to the end desired by all of them individually.
The idea of the whole thus operates to create the group, to bring it
into existence; and then, as the idea is realised, it becomes more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
definite, of richer and more exact meaning; the collective sentiment
grows up about it, and habit and formal organisation begin to aid
in holding the group together; yet still the idea of the whole remains
constitutive of the whole.</p>

<p>Any group that owes its creation and its continued existence to
the collective idea may be regarded from the psychological standpoint
as of the highest type; while a fortuitously gathered crowd
that owes its existence to accidents of time and place and has the
barest minimum of group self-consciousness is of the lowest type.
Every other form of association or of human group may be regarded
as occupying a position in a scale between these extreme types;
according to the relative predominance of the mental or the physical
conditions of its origin and continuance, that is to say, according
to the degree in which its existence is teleologically or mechanically
determined.</p>

<p>The group spirit, the idea of the group with the sentiment of
devotion to the group developed in the minds of all its members,
not only serves as a bond that holds the group together or even
creates it, but, as we saw in the case of the patriot army, it renders
possible truly collective volition; this in turn renders the actions of
the group much more resolute and effective than they could be, so
long as its actions proceed merely from the presence of an impulse
common to all members, or from the strictly individual volitions of
all, even though these be directed to one common end.</p>

<p>Again, the group spirit plays an important part in raising the
intellectual level of the group; for it leads each member deliberately
to subordinate his own judgment and opinion to that of the whole;
and, in any properly organised group, this collective opinion will be
superior to that of the average individual, because in its formation
the best minds, acting upon the fullest knowledge to the gathering
of which all may contribute, will be of predominant influence. Each
member, then, willing the common end, accepts the means chosen
by the organised collective deliberation, and, in executing the actions
prescribed for him, makes them his own immediate ends and truly
wills them for the sake of the whole, not executing them in the spirit
of merely mechanical unintelligent obedience or even of reluctance.</p>

<p>In a similar way the group spirit aids in raising the moral level
of an army. The organised whole embodies certain traditional sentiments,
especially sentiments of admiration for certain moral qualities,
courage, endurance, trustworthiness, and cheerful obedience; and
these sentiments, permeating the whole, are impressed upon every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
member, especially new members, by way of mass suggestion and
sympathetic contagion; every new recruit finds that his comrades
accept without question these traditional moral sentiments and
confidently express moral judgments upon conduct and character
in accordance with them, and that they also display the corresponding
emotional reactions towards acts; that is to say, they express
in verbal judgments and in emotional reactions their scorn for
treachery or cowardice, their admiration for courageous self-sacrifice
and devotion to duty. The recruit quickly shares by contagion these
moral emotions and soon finds his judgment determined to share
these opinions by the weight of mass suggestion; for these moral
propositions come to him with all the irresistible force of opinion
held by the group and expressed by its unanimous voice; and this
force is not merely the force derived from numbers, but is also the
force of the prestige accumulated by the whole group, the prestige
of old and well-tried tradition, the prestige of age; and the more fully
the consciousness of the whole group is present to the mind of each
member, the more effectively will the whole impress its moral precepts
upon each.</p>

<p>And the organisation of the army renders it possible for the
leaders to influence and to mould the form of these moral opinions
and sentiments. Thus Lord Kitchener, by issuing his exhortation to
the British Army on its departure to France, did undoubtedly exert
a considerable influence towards raising the moral level of the whole
force, because he strengthened the influence of those who were
already of his way of thinking against the influence of those whose
sentiments and habits and opinions made in the opposite direction.
His great prestige, which was of a double kind, both personal and
due to his high office, enabled him to do this. In the same way,
every officer in a less degree can do something to raise the moral
level of the men under his command. Thus, then, the organisation
of the whole group, with its hierarchy of offices which confer prestige,
gives those who hold these higher offices the opportunity to raise
the moral level of all members.</p>

<p>Of course, if those who occupy these positions of prestige feel no
responsibility of this sort and make no effort to exert such influence,
but rather aim at striking terror in the foe at all costs, if they
countenance acts of savagery such as the destruction of cities,
looting, and rapine, if they publicly instruct their soldiers to behave
as Huns or savages; then the organisation of the army works in the
opposite way&mdash;namely, to degrade all members below their normal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
individual level, rather than to raise them above it; and then we
hear of acts of brutality on the part of the rank and file which are
almost incredible.</p>

<p>But the main point to be insisted on here is that the raising of
the moral level is not effected only by example, suggestion, and
emotional contagion, spreading from those in the positions of prestige;
that, where the group spirit exists, those enjoying prestige can, if
they wish, greatly promote the end of raising the moral tone of the
whole by appealing to that group spirit; as when Lord Kitchener
asked the men to obey his injunctions for the sake of the honour of
the British Army.</p>

<p>And the group spirit not only yields this direct response to moral
exhortation; it operates in another no less important manner. Each
member of a group pervaded by the collective sentiment, such as
a well-organised army of high traditions, becomes in a special sense
his brother&#8217;s keeper. Each feels an interest in the conduct of every
other member, because the conduct of each affects the reputation
of the whole; each man, therefore, punishes bad conduct of any fellow
soldier by scorn and by withdrawal of sympathy and companionship;
and each one rewards with praise and admiration the conduct that
conforms to the standards demanded and admired. And so each
member acts always under the jealous eyes of all his fellows, under
the threat of general disapprobation, contempt, and moral isolation
for bad conduct; under the promise of general approval and admiration
for any act of special excellence.</p>

<p>The development of the group spirit, with the appropriate sentiment
of attachment or devotion to the whole and therefore also to
its parts, is the essence of the higher form of military discipline.
There is a lower form of discipline which aims only at rendering each
man perfectly subservient to his officers and trained to respond
promptly and invariably, in precise, semi-mechanical, habitual
fashion, to every word of command. But even the drill and the
system of penalties and minute supervision, which are the means
chosen to bring about this result, cannot fail to achieve certain
effects on a higher moral and intellectual level than the mere formation
of bodily habits of response. By rendering each soldier apt and
exact in his response to commands, they enable each one to foresee
the actions of his fellows in all ordinary circumstances, and therefore
to rely upon that co-operation towards the common end, be it merely
a turning movement on the drill ground or the winning of a battle,
which is the essential aim and justification of all group life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The group spirit, involving knowledge of the group as such, some
idea of the group, and some sentiment of devotion or attachment
to the group, is then the essential condition of all developed collective
life, and of all effective collective action; but it is by no means
confined to highly developed human associations of a voluntary
kind.</p>

<p>Whether the group spirit is possessed in any degree by animal
societies is a very difficult question. We certainly do not need to
postulate it in order to account for the existence of more or less
enduring associations of animals; just as we do not need to postulate
it to account for the coming together of any fortuitous human mob.
Even in such animal societies as those of the ants and bees, its
presence, though often asserted, seems to be highly questionable.
When we observe the division of labour that characterises the hive,
how some bees ventilate, some build the comb, some feed the larvae
and so on; and especially when we hear that the departure of a
swarm from the hive is preceded by the explorations of a small
number which seek a suitable place for the new home of the swarm
and then guide it to the chosen spot, it seems difficult to deny
that some idea of the community and its needs is present to the
minds of its members. But we know so little as yet of the limits
of purely instinctive behaviour (and by that I mean immediate
reactions upon sense-perceptions determined by the innate constitution)
that it would be rash to make any such inference. The same
may be said of associations of birds or mammals, in which division
of labour is frequently displayed; when, for example, it is found that
one or more sentinels constantly keep watch while a flock or herd
feeds or rests, as is reported of many gregarious species.</p>

<p>But, however it may be with animal societies, we may confidently
assert that the group spirit has played an important part in the
lives of all enduring human groups, from the most primitive ages
onwards.</p>

<p>It has even been maintained with some plausibility that group
self-consciousness preceded individual self-consciousness in the
course of the evolution of the human mind. That again is, it seems
to me, a proposition which cannot be substantiated. But it is, I
think, true to say that the two kinds of self-consciousness must have
been achieved by parallel processes, which constantly reacted upon
one another in reciprocal promotion.</p>

<p>In the lives of the humblest savages the group spirit plays an
immensely important part. It is the rule that a savage is born into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a small closed community. Such a community generally has its own
locality within which it remains, even if nomadic; and, if settled, it
wholly lives in a village, widely separated in space from all others.
In this small community the child grows up, becoming more or less
intimately acquainted with every member of it, and having practically
no intercourse with any other persons. Throughout his childhood
he learns its laws and traditions, becomes acutely aware of its
public opinion, and finds his welfare absolutely bound up with that
of the village community. He cannot leave it if he would; the only
alternative open to him is to become an outcast, as which he would
very soon succumb in the struggle for life. There is nothing comparable
with this in our complex civilised societies. The nearest
parallel to it is the case of the young child growing up in a
peculiarly secluded family isolated in the depths of the country.</p>

<p>This restriction of the intercourse of the young savage to the
members of his own small society and his absolute dependence upon
it for all that makes his survival possible would in themselves
suffice to develop his group consciousness in a high degree. But two
other conditions, well-nigh universal in savage life, tend strongly
towards the same result.</p>

<p>When the young savage begins to come into contact with persons
other than those of his own group, he learns to know them, not
as individuals, John Smith or Tom Brown, but as men of such or
such a group; and he himself is known to them as a man of his
group, as representing his group, his village community, tribe, or
what not; and he displays usually some mark or marks of his group,
either in dress or ornament or speech.</p>

<p>The other great condition of the development of the group spirit
in primitive societies is the general recognition of communal responsibility.
This no doubt is largely the result of the two conditions
previously mentioned, especially of the recognition of an individual
by members of other groups as merely a representative of his group,
rather than as an individual, and of the fact that his deeds, or those
of any one of his fellows, determine the attitudes of other groups
towards his group as a whole. But the influence of the principle of
communal responsibility, thus established, becomes immensely
strengthened by its recognition in a number of superstitious and
religious observances. The savage lives, generally speaking, bound
hand and foot by <i>tabus</i> and precise prescriptions of behaviour for all
ordinary situations; and the breach of any one of these by any
member of the community is held to bring down misfortune or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
punishment on the whole group; so far is this principle carried, that
the breach of custom by some individual is confidently inferred from
the incidence of any communal misfortune<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>The recognition of communal responsibility is the great conservator
of savage society and customary law, the very root and
stem of all savage morality; it is the effective moral sanction without
which the superstitious and religious sanctions would be of little
effect. By its means, the idea of the community is constantly
obtruded on the consciousness of the individual. Through it he is
constantly led, or forced, to control his individualistic impulses and
to undertake action with regard to the welfare of the group rather
than to his own private interest. Through it the tendency of each
to identify himself and each of his fellows with the whole group is
constantly fostered; because it identifies their interests.</p>

<p>We may then say that, just as the direct induction of emotion
and impulse by sense-perception of their bodily expressions is the
cement of animal societies, so group self-consciousness is the cement
and harmonising principle of primitive human societies.</p>

<p>And the group spirit is not only highly effective in promoting
the life and welfare of the group; it is also the source of peculiar
satisfactions. The individual revels in his group-consciousness;
hence the principle is apt to run riot in savage societies, and we
find that in very many parts of the world a great variety of complex
forms of association is maintained, beside the primary and fundamental
form of association of the village community or nomadic
band (the kinship or subsistence group), apparently for no other
reason than the attainment and intensification of the satisfactions
of the group spirit. Hence, among peoples so low in the scale of
savagery as the Australians, we find a most complex system of grouping
cutting across the subsistence grouping; hence totem clans and
phratries, exogamous groups, secret societies, initiation ceremonies.</p>

<p>I lay stress on the satisfaction which group self-consciousness
brings as a condition or cause of these complexities of savage society,
because, I think, it has been unduly neglected as a socialising factor
and a determinant of the forms of association. If we ask&mdash;What
are the sources of this satisfaction?&mdash;we may find two answers.
First, the consciousness of the group and of oneself as a member of
it brings a sense of power and security, an assurance of sympathy
and co-operation, a moral and physical support without which man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
can hardly face the world. In a thousand situations it is a source
of settled opinions and of definite guidance of conduct which obviates
the most uncomfortable and difficult necessity of exerting independent
judgment and making up one&#8217;s own mind. And in many
such situations, not only does the savage find a definite code prescribed
for his guidance, but he shares the collective emotion and
feels the collective impulse that carries him on to action without
hesitation or timidity.</p>

<p>Secondly, we may, I think, go back to a very fundamental
principle of instinctive life, the principle, namely, that, in gregarious
animals, the satisfaction of the gregarious impulse is greater or more
complete the more nearly alike are the individuals congregated
together. This seems to be true of the animals, but it is true in a
higher degree of man; and, in proportion as his mind becomes more
specialised and refined, the more exacting is he in this respect. To
the uncultivated any society is better than none; but in the cultivated
classes we become extraordinarily exacting; we find the
gregarious satisfaction in our own peculiar <i>set</i> only&mdash;a process
carried furthest, perhaps, in university circles. In savage life this
shows itself in practices which accentuate the likeness of members of a
group and mark it off more distinctly from other groups&mdash;for example,
totems, peculiarities of dress, ornaments and ceremonies; things
which are closely paralleled by the clubs, blazers, colours, cries, and
so forth of our undergraduate communities.</p>

<p>The life of the savage, then, is in general dominated by that of
the group; and this domination is not effected by physical force or
compulsion (save in exceptional instances) but by the group spirit
which is inevitably developed in the mind of the savage child by
the material circumstances of his life and by the traditions, especially
the superstitious and religious traditions, of his community. Such
group self-consciousness is the principal moralising influence, and to
this influence is due in the main the fact that savages conform so
strictly to their accepted moral codes.</p>

<p>Group self-consciousness in savage communities brings then, I
suggest, two great advantages which account for the spontaneous
development and persistence among so many savage peoples of what,
from a narrowly utilitarian point of view, might seem to be an excess
of group organisation, such as the totemic systems of the Australians
and of the American Indians;&mdash;namely, firstly, the moralising influences
of the group spirit; secondly, the satisfactions or enjoyments
immediately accruing to every participant in active group life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>And these two advantages, being in some degree appreciated, lead
to a deliberate cultivation of group life for the securing of them in
higher measure. The cultivation of group life shows itself in the many
varieties of grouping on a purely artificial basis and in the practice
of rites and ceremonies, especially dances, often accompanied by
song and other music. There is nothing that so intensifies group
consciousness, at the cost of consciousness of individuality, as ceremonial
dancing and singing; especially when the dance consists of
a series of extravagant bizarre movements, executed by every
member of the group in unison, the series of movements being at
the same time peculiar to the particular group that practises them
and symbolical of the peculiar functions or properties claimed by
the group. Many savage dances have these characters in perfection;
as, for example, those of the Murray islanders of Torres Straits,
where, as I have witnessed, the several totemic groups&mdash;the dog-men,
the pigeon-men, the shark-men, and other such groups&mdash;continue, in
spite of the partial destruction by missionaries of their totemistic
beliefs, to revel in night-long gatherings, at which each group in
turn mimics, in fantastic dances and with solemn delight, the movements
of its totem animal.</p>

<p>The importance of group consciousness in savage life has been
recently much insisted on by some anthropologists, and indeed, in
my view, overstated. Cornford<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> writes &#8220;When the totem-clan meets
to hold its peculiar dance, to work itself up till it feels the pulsing
of its common life through all its members, such nascent sense of
individuality as a savage may have&mdash;it is always very faint&mdash;is
merged and lost; his consciousness is filled with a sense of sympathetic
activity. The group is now feeling and acting as one soul,
with a total force much greater than any of its members could
exercise in isolation. The individual is lost, &#8216;beside himself,&#8217; in one
of those states of contagious enthusiasm in which it is well known
that men become capable of feats which far outrange their normal
powers.&#8221; And again &#8220;Over and above their individual experience,
all the members of the group alike partake of what has been called
the collective consciousness of the group as a whole. Unlike their
private experience, this pervading consciousness is the same in all,
consisting in those epidemic or infectious states of feeling above
described, which, at times when the common functions are being
exercised, invade the whole field of mentality, and submerge the
individual areas. To this group-consciousness belong also, from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
first moment of their appearance all representations which are
collective, a class in which all religious representations are included.
These likewise are diffused over the whole mentality of the group,
and identical in all its members.... The collective consciousness is
thus super-individual. It resides, of course, in the individuals composing
the group. There is nowhere else for it to exist, but it resides
in all of them together and not completely in any one of them. It
is both in myself and yet not myself. It occupies a certain part of
my mind and yet it stretches beyond and outside me to the limits
of my group. And since I am only a small part of my group, there
is much more of it outside me than inside. Its force therefore is
much greater than my individual force, and the more primitive I
am the greater this preponderance will be. Here, then, there exists
in the world a power which is much greater than any individual&#8217;s&mdash;super-individual,
that is to say superhuman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because this force is continuous with my own consciousness, it
is, as it were, a reservoir to which I have access, and from which I
can absorb superhuman power to reinforce and enhance my own.
This is its positive aspect&mdash;in so far as this power is not myself and
greater than myself, it is a moral and restraining force, which can
and does impose upon the individual the necessity of observing the
uniform behaviour of the group.&#8221; This writer makes group consciousness
the source of both morality and religion. &#8220;The collective
consciousness is also immanent in the individual himself, forming
within him that unreasoning impulse called conscience, which like
a traitor within the gates, acknowledges from within the obligation
to obey that other and much larger part of the collective consciousness
which lies outside. Small wonder that obedience is absolute in
primitive man, whose individuality is still restricted to a comparatively
small field, while all the higher levels of mentality are occupied
by this overpowering force<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.&#8221; The first religious idea is that of &#8220;this
collective consciousness, the only moral power which can come to be
felt as imposed from without.&#8221; And Cornford goes yet further
and makes of the group self-consciousness the source of magic
as well as of religion and morality. This primary reservoir of
super-individual power splits, he says, into two pools, human and
non-human; the former is magic power, the latter is divine power.</p>

<p>On this I would comment as follows. Although Cornford is right
in insisting upon the large influence of group consciousness, he is
wrong, I think, in underestimating individuality. He does not go so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
far as some writers who suggest that group self-consciousness actually
precedes individual self-consciousness, but he says of individual self-consciousness
that it is but very faint in savages. I am more inclined
to agree with Lotze, who in a famous passage asserted that even the
crushed worm is in an obscure way aware of itself and its pain as
set over against the world. Many facts of savage behaviour forbid
us to accept the extreme view that denies them individual self-consciousness&mdash;individual
names, secret names, private property,
private rites, religious and magical, individual revenge, jealousy,
running <i>amok</i>, leadership, self-assertion, pride, vanity, competition
in games of skill and in technical and artistic achievement. The
flourishing of these and many other such things in primitive communities
reveals clearly enough to the unbiassed observer in the
field the effective presence of individual self-consciousness in the
savage mind. In this connexion I may refer to two pieces of evidence
bearing very directly on the question reported by Dr C. Hose and
myself. Among the Sea-Dayaks or Ibans of Borneo we discovered the
prevalence of the belief in the &#8216;nyarong&#8217; or private &#8216;spirit helper,&#8217; some
spiritual or animated individual power which a fortunate individual
here and there finds reason to believe is attached to him personally
for his guidance and help in all difficult situations. His belief in this
personal helper and the rites by aid of which he communicates with
it are kept secret from his fellows; so that it was only after long and
intimate acquaintance with these people that Dr Hose began to
suspect the existence of this peculiarly individualistic belief<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. In
the same volumes we have described the Punans of Borneo, a people
whose mode of life is in every respect extremely primitive. In this
respect they are perhaps unequalled by any other existing people.
Yet no one who is acquainted with these amiable folk could doubt
that, although their group consciousness is highly developed, they
enjoy also a well developed individual self-consciousness. How otherwise
can we interpret the fact that a Punan who suffers malicious
injury from a member of another tribe will nurse his vengeful feeling
for an indefinite period and, after the lapse of years, will find an
opportunity to bring down his enemy secretly with blow-pipe and
poisoned dart?</p>

<p>With Mr Cornford&#8217;s view of the part played by the group spirit in
moralising conduct I agree. I agree also that it is the collective life
or mind that develops religion and in part magic; but in my view
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Cornford attributes to the savage far too much reflective theorising;
he represents him as formulating a theory of the collective consciousness
which is really almost identical with the interesting
speculation of M. L&eacute;vy Bruhl presently to be noticed, and he regards
his conduct, his religious and magical practices, as guided by these
theories. But that is to reverse the true order of things&mdash;to make
theory precede practice; whereas in reality, especially in religion
and magic, practice has everywhere preceded theory, often, as in
this case, by thousands of generations<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>It is true that the savage often behaves as though he held this
theory of the collective consciousness as a field of force in which he
participates; that his conduct seems to require such a theory for
its rational justification. But it by no means follows that he has
formulated any theory at all. What the savage is conscious of is,
not a collective consciousness as a mysterious superhuman power,
but the group itself, the group of concrete embodied fellow men. He
behaves and feels as he does, because participation in the life of
the group directly modifies his individual tendencies and directly
evokes these feelings and actions; he does not discover, or seek,
any theory by which to explain them. Still less is it true that he
performs these actions because he has formulated a theory of a
collective consciousness.</p>

<p>Mr Cornford regards the savage idea of a collective consciousness
as the germ of the idea of divine power or of God. Now this
is connected with the question of animism, preanimism, and dynanimism.
It may be true that the notion of <i>mana</i> is the common
prime source of religious and magical ideas, but it does not follow
that the idea of God is arrived at by way of a notion of collective
<i>mana</i>. No doubt that would be the probable course of events, if
the savage had so little sense of his individuality as Cornford
supposes; but it seems to me rather that the savage&#8217;s strong sense
of individuality has led at an early stage to the personalisation, the
individuation, of <i>mana</i>, the vaguely conceived spiritual power and
influence, and that it was only by a long course of religious and
philosophical speculation that men reached the conception of the
Absolute or of God as a universal power of which each personal
consciousness is a partial manifestation.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, if we could accept Cornford&#8217;s
views, we could now claim to witness the completion of one full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
cycle of the wheel of speculation, the last step having been made
in an article in a recent number of the <i>Hibbert Journal</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>; for it is there
suggested that the only God or super-individual power we ought to
recognise and revere is, not a collective consciousness conceived as
a supra-individual unity of consciousness, but the collective mind of
humanity in the sense in which I am using the term, a system of
mental forces that slowly progresses towards greater harmony and
integration.</p>

<p>M. L&eacute;vy Bruhl has written an interesting, though highly speculative,
account of savage mental life which he represents as differing
profoundly from our own, chiefly in that it is dominated by
&#8216;collective representations<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.&#8217; His view is not unlike that put forward
by Cornford.</p>

<p>Collective representations or ideas are rightly said to be the
product of the group mind rather than of any individual mind; that
is to say, they have been gradually evolved by collective mental
life; and they are said to differ from our ideas in being &#8220;states more
complex in which the emotional and motor elements are integral
parts of the ideas.&#8221; Thinking by aid of these collective representations
is said to have its own laws quite distinct from the laws of
logic.</p>

<p>These statements are no doubt correct; but both L&eacute;vy Bruhl
and Cornford commit the great error of assuming that the mental
life of civilised man is conducted by each individual in a purely
rational and logical manner; they overlook the fact that we also
are largely dominated by collective representations; for these collective
representations are nothing but ideas of objects to which
traditional sentiments, sentiments of awe, of fear, of respect, of love,
of reverence, are attached. Almost the whole of the religion and
morality of the average civilised man is based on his acquisition of
such collective representations, traditional sentiments grown up
about ideas of objects, ideas which he receives ready made and
sentiments which are impressed upon him by the community that
has evolved them.</p>

<p>It is no doubt true that in the main the field of objects to which
collective representations apply is larger in savage life; and these
ideas are more uniform and more powerful and unquestioned,
because the group is more homogeneous in its sentiments. But it is,
fortunately, only a rare individual here and there among us who in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
considerable degree emancipates himself from the influence of such
representations and becomes capable of confronting all objects about
him in a perfectly cool, critical, logical attitude&mdash;who can &#8220;peep and
botanise upon his mother&#8217;s grave.&#8221; Only by strict intellectual
discipline do we progress towards strictly logical operations in relation
to real life, towards pure judgments of fact as opposed to
judgments of value. For our judgments of value are rooted in our
sentiments; and whatever is for us an object of a sentiment of love
or hate, of attachment or aversion, can only with the greatest
difficulty, if at all, be made an object of a pure judgment of fact.</p>

<p>And Cornford and L&eacute;vy Bruhl make the same mistake in regard
to &#8216;collective representations&#8217; as in regard to the group self-consciousness&mdash;namely,
they credit the savage with theories for the
explanation of the beliefs implicitly involved in the &#8216;collective representations,&#8217;
for example, the theory of mystic participation, which
is said to replace for the savage the civilised man&#8217;s theory of mechanical
causation. But, when we regard any material object as
holy, or sacred, or as of peculiar value, because it was given us by
a departed friend, or belonged to and perhaps was once worn by
a beloved person, our behaviour towards it is not determined by
any theory of participation; if, for example, we touch it tenderly and
with reverent care, that is the direct expression of our feeling. We
even behave as if we held the theory of participation, to the extent
of believing that the dead or distant person will suffer pain if we ill-use
or neglect the object which is associated with him in our minds,
but without actually holding that belief; and still more without
elaborating a theory of the nature of the process by which our action
will produce such an effect. It is only a late and highly sophisticated
reflection upon behaviour of this kind which leads to theories for
the justification of such behaviour. It is not true, then, that we are
logical individuals, while savages are wholly prelogical in virtue of
the dominance among them of the collective mental life. The truth
rather is that, wherever emotion qualifies our intellectual operations,
it renders them other than purely and strictly logical; and the savage
or the civilised man departs more widely from the strictly logical
conduct of his intellect, in proportion as his conceptions of things
are absorbed without critical reflection and analysis and are coloured
with the traditional sentiments of his community. The average
savage, being more deeply immersed in his group, suffers these effects
more strongly than the average civilised man. Yet the interval in
this respect between the modern man of scientific culture and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
average citizen of our modern states is far greater than that between
the latter and the savage.</p>

<p>If one had to name the principal difference between the conditions
of life of the typical savage and those of the average civilised man,
one would, I think, have to point to the lack in civilised life of those
conditions which so inevitably develop the group consciousness of
the savage. The family circle supplies to the young child something
of these conditions, but in a very imperfect degree only. At an
early age this influence is much weakened by general intercourse.
As the individual approaches maturity, he finds himself at liberty
to cut himself off completely from all his natural setting, to transplant
himself to any part of the world, and to share in the life of
any civilised community. He can earn his livelihood anywhere, and
he knows nothing of communal responsibility.</p>

<p>Progressive weakening of the conditions that force the development
of group self-consciousness has characterised the whole course
of the development of civilisation, and has reached its climax in the
conditions of life in our large cities.</p>

<p>In primitive communities the conditions of group self-consciousness
are, as we have seen, fourfold; namely kinship, territorial,
traditional and occupational association. All these are present in
the highest degree in the nomadic group under the typical patriarchal
system.</p>

<p>When kinship groups take to agriculture and become permanently
settled on one spot, the kinship factor tends to be weakened, through
the inclusion of alien elements; and the territorial factor becomes
the most important condition. Throughout European history the
territorial factor, expressing itself in the form of the village-community,
remained of universal importance in this respect; the Roman
Empire and the Roman Church weakened it greatly; but everywhere
outside those spheres it continued to be of dominant importance
until the great social revolution of the modern industrial period.</p>

<p>The village community maintained much of the tradition and
custom that tend to develop group self-consciousness with its
moralising influence. But at the present time almost the only condition
of wide and general influence that continues in times of peace
to foster group self-consciousness is occupational association. And
so we find men tending more and more to be grouped for all serious
collective activities according to their occupations. From the earliest
development of European industry this tendency has been strong;
it produced the trading and craft guilds which played so great a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
part in medieval Europe; and, though the monarchical and capitalistic
regimes of modern times have done all they can to repress and
break up these occupational groups, and have greatly restricted
their influence, they have failed to suppress them entirely. The
climax of this tendency for the occupational to replace and overshadow
all other forms of self-conscious grouping is present-day
Syndicalism.</p>

<p>The natural conditions of group self-consciousness, which in
primitive societies rendered its development inevitable and spontaneous
in every man, have then been in the main destroyed. But
man cannot stand alone; men cannot live happily as mere individuals;
they desire and crave and seek membership in a group, in whose
collective opinions and emotions and self-consciousness and activities
they may share, with which they may identify themselves, thereby
lessening the burden of individual responsibility, judgment, decision
and effort.</p>

<p>Hence in this age the natural groupings and the involuntary
developments of group consciousness are largely replaced by an
enormous development of artificial voluntary groupings, over and
above the natural groupings that are still only in very imperfect
measure determined by the weakened force of the natural conditions,
namely kinship, neighbourhood and occupation.</p>

<p>In part these artificial groupings are designed to reinforce the
natural conditions, as, for example, village festivals. The whole
population of a country such as our own is permeated by a vast and
complexly interwoven, or rather tangled, skein of the bonds of
voluntary associations. Many of these are, of course, formed to
undertake some definite work, to achieve some end which can only be
achieved by co-operative effort. But in the majority of such cases the
satisfactions yielded by group life play a very great part in leading
to the formation of and in maintaining the groups, for example,
groups of philanthropic workers, the makers of charity bazaars, the
salvation army, the churches, the chapels, the sects. Most of such
associations that have any success and continuity of existence
contain a nucleus of persons who identify themselves in the fullest
possible manner with the group, make its interest their leading
concern, the desire of its welfare their dominant motive, and find
in its service their principal satisfaction and happiness.</p>

<p>And in very many voluntary associations the group-motives, the
desire for the satisfactions to be found in group life, are of prime
importance, predominating vastly over the desire to achieve any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
particular end by co-operative action. Such are our countless clubs
and societies formed frankly for recreation, or for mutual improvement,
and for all kinds of ostensible purposes which serve merely as
excuses or reasons for the existence of the club. In the majority of
instances these declared purposes really serve merely or chiefly to
exert a certain natural selection of persons, to bring together persons
of similar tastes as voluntary associates, to enable, in short, birds of
a feather to flock together. Even some of our enduring historical
institutions owe their continuance chiefly to the advantages and
satisfactions that proceed from group consciousness, for example,
colleges, school-houses, and political parties, especially perhaps in
America. Party feeling, as Sir H. Maine rightly said, is frequently
a remedy for the inertia of democracy.</p>

<p>The savage, when he maintains associations other than those
determined by natural conditions, intensifies his group consciousness
by wearing badges and totem marks, by tatooing and scarring, and
by indulging in various rites and ceremonies, about which a certain
secrecy and mystery is maintained. And civilised men exhibit just
the same tendency and take very similar measures to intensify group
consciousness. We have our club colours and ribbons and blazers,
our college gowns and colours, our Oxford accent, our badges of
membership, and so on. Freemasonry, with its lodges and badges and
mysterious rites, seems to be the purest example on a large scale.
And, when the group consciousness and the group sentiment have
been acquired, we continue to cultivate it purely for its own sake,
by holding annual dinners and reunions of old boys, and so forth.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance that this tendency to seek and
maintain a share in group consciousness, which, as we have seen,
manifests itself everywhere even under the most adverse conditions,
not merely yields comfort and satisfaction to individuals, but brings
about results which are in almost every way extremely advantageous
for the higher development of human life in general.</p>

<p>We have seen that, in the well-organised group, collective deliberation,
judgment, and action are raised to a higher plane of
effectiveness than is possible to the average member of the group.
But apart from that, the group spirit continues with us, as with
the savage (though in a less effective degree) to be the great socialising
agency. In the majority of cases it is the principal, if not the
sole, factor which raises a man&#8217;s conduct above the plane of pure
egoism, leads him to think and care and work for others as well as
for himself. Try to imagine any man wholly deprived of his group
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
consciousness and set over against all his fellowmen as an individual
unit, and you will see that you could expect but little from him in
the way of self-sacrifice or public service&mdash;at most a care for his
wife and children and sporadic acts of kindliness when direct appeals
are made to his pity; but none of that energetic and devoted public
service and faithful self-sacrificing co-operation without which the
continued welfare of any human society is impossible.</p>

<p>The group spirit destroys the opposition and the conflict between
the crudely individualistic and the primitive altruistic tendencies of
our nature.</p>

<p>This is the peculiar merit and efficiency of the complex motives
that arise from the group spirit; they bring the egoistic self-seeking
impulses into the service of society and harmonise them with the
altruistic tendencies. The group spirit secures that the egoistic and
the altruistic tendencies of each man&#8217;s nature, instead of being in
perpetual conflict, as they must be in its absence, shall harmoniously
co-operate and re-enforce one another throughout a large part of the
total field of human activity.</p>

<p>For it is of the essence of the group spirit that the individual
identifies himself, as we say, with the group more or less; that is to
say, in technical language, his self-regarding sentiment becomes
extended to the group more or less completely, so that he is moved
to desire and to work for its welfare, its success, its honour and glory,
by the same motives which prompt him to desire and to work for
his own welfare and success and honour; as in the case of the student
working for a scholarship or university prize, or the member of an
exploring expedition or fighting group. Further, the motives supplied
by the group spirit may be stronger than, and may overpower,
the purely individualistic egoistic motives, just because they harmonise
with, and are supported by, any altruistic tendency or
tendencies comprised in the make up of the individual; which altruistic
tendencies will, where the group spirit is lacking, oppose and
weaken the effects of purely egoistic motives. To illustrate this
principle, let us imagine an Englishman who, in a Congo forest,
finds a white man sick or in difficulties. To succour the sick man
may be to incur grave risks, and he is tempted to pass on; but the
thought comes to him that in so doing he will lower the prestige of
the white man in the eyes of the natives; and this idea, evoking the
motives of the group spirit which unites all white men in such a land,
brings victory to his sense of pity in its struggle with selfish fear.</p>

<p>In this way, that is by extension to the group, the egoistic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
impulses are transmuted, sublimated, and deprived of their individualistic
selfish character and effects and are turned to public
service. Hence it is that it is generally so difficult or impossible to
analyse the motives of any public service or social activity and to
display them as either purely egoistic or altruistic; for they are, as
Herbert Spencer called them, ego-altruistic. And hence it comes
about that both the cynic and the idealist can make out plausible
cases, when they seek to show that either egoism or altruism predominates
in human life. Both are right in a partial sense.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy feature of the group spirit renders it
extremely effective in promoting social life; namely the fact that, although
the group sentiment is apt to determine an attitude of rivalry,
competition, and antagonism towards similarly constituted groups,
yet a man may share in the self-consciousness of more groups than
one, so long as their natures and aims do not necessarily bring them
into rivalry. And in our complex modern societies this principle of
multiple group consciousness in each man is of extreme importance;
for without it, and in the absence or comparative lack of the natural
conditions of grouping other than the occupational, the whole population
would become divided into occupational groups, each fighting
collectively against every other for the largest possible share of the
good things of life. A tendency towards this state of things is very
perceptible, in spite of the correcting cross-connexions of kinship, of
church and political party, and of territorial association.</p>

<p>But another principle of multiple group consciousness is, perhaps,
of still greater importance, namely that it allows the formation of
a hierarchy of group sentiments for a system of groups in which
each larger group includes the lesser; each group being made the
object of the extended self-regarding sentiment in a way which includes
the sentiment for the lesser group in the sentiment for the
larger group in which it is comprised. Thus the family, the village,
the county, the country as a whole, form for the normal man the
objects of a harmonious hierarchy of sentiments of this sort, each of
which strengthens rather than weakens the others, and yields motives
for action which on the whole co-operate and harmonise rather than
conflict.</p>

<p>Such a hierarchy is seen in savage life. It often happens that
a man is called on to join in the defence of some village of the tribe
other than his own. In such cases he is moved not only by his
tribal sentiment, but also by his sentiments for his village and family.
The sentiment for the part supports the sentiment for the whole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>It is of considerable importance also that in general the development
of a sentiment of attachment to one group not only does not
prevent, but rather facilitates, the development of similar sentiments
for other groups. And this is especially true when the groups concerned
are related to one another as parts and wholes, that is, when they
form a hierarchy of successively more widely inclusive groups. The
sentiment for the smaller group (e.g. the family) naturally develops
first in the child&#8217;s mind; if only for the reason that this is the group
of which he can first form a definite idea, and with the whole of which
he is in immediate relations. The strong development of this first
group sentiment prepares the child&#8217;s mind for the development
of other and wider group sentiments. For it increases his power
of grasping intellectually the group of persons as a complex whole;
and it strengthens by exercise those impulses or primary tendencies
which must enter into the constitution of any group sentiment; and,
thirdly, it prevents the excessive development of the purely individualistic
attitude, of the habit of looking at every situation and
weighing all values from the strictly individualistic and egoistic
standpoint; which attitude, if once it becomes habitual, must form
a powerful hindrance to the development of the wider group sentiments,
when the child arrives at an age to grasp the idea of the larger
group.</p>

<p>The organisation of an army again illustrates these principles in
relatively clear and simple fashion. In our own army the regiment
is the traditional self-conscious unit about which traditional sentiment
and ritual have been carefully fostered, in part through
realisation of their practical importance, in part because this unit
is of such a size and nature as to be well suited to call out strongly
the natural group tendencies of its component individuals. On the
whole the military authorities, and especially Lord Haldane in the
formation of the territorial army, seem to have wisely recognised
the importance of the group spirit of the regiment; although during
the Great War it was, under the pressure of other considerations,
apparently lost sight of at certain times and places, with, I believe,
deplorable consequences.</p>

<p>In modern warfare, and especially in the Great War, the Division
has tended to become of predominant importance as the unit of
organisation; and accordingly, without destroying or superseding
regimental group consciousness, the sentiment for the Division has
been in many instances a very strong factor in promoting the
spiritual cohesion and efficiency of the army. Certain Divisions, such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
as the 10th and the 29th, have covered themselves with glory, so
that the soldiers have learnt to feel a great pride in and a devotion
to the Division.</p>

<p>This larger group, although of comparatively ephemeral existence
and therefore devoid of long traditions coming down from the past,
is in perfect and obvious harmony, in purpose and spirit and material
organisation, with the battalions and other units of which it is
composed; and, accordingly, the sentiment for the larger group does
not enter into rivalry with that for the battalion, the battery, or
other smaller unit; rather it comprises this within its own organisation
and derives energy and stability from it.</p>

<p>These psychological principles of group consciousness are, I think,
well borne out inductively, by any comparative survey; that is to
say, we find that, where family sentiment and the sentiment for the
local group are strong, there also the wider group sentiments are
strong, and good citizenship, patriotism, and ready devotion to public
services of all kinds are the rule. The strongest most stable States
have always been those in which family sentiment has been strong,
especially those in which it has been strengthened and supported
by the custom of ancestor worship, as in Rome, Japan and China.
Scotchmen again (Highlanders especially) are noted for clannishness,
and Scotch cousins have become a bye-word; a fact which implies
the great strength of the family sentiment. The clan sentiment,
which is clearly only an extension of the family sentiment, is also
notoriously strong. The sentiment for Scotland as a whole is no less
strong in the hearts of all her sons. But, and this is the important
point, these strong group sentiments are perfectly compatible with
and probably conducive to a sentiment for the still wider group,
Great Britain or the British Empire; and the public services
rendered to these larger groups by men of Scottish birth are equally
notorious.</p>

<p>In these considerations we may see, I think, a principal ground
of the importance of the institution of the family for the welfare of
the state. The importance has often been insisted upon; but too
much stress is usually laid upon the material aspects, and not enough
upon the mental effects, of family life.</p>

<p>It has been a grave mistake on the part of many collectivists,
from Plato onwards, that they have sought to destroy the family
and to bring up all children as the children of the state only, in some
kind of barrack system. It is not too much to say that, if they could
succeed in this (and in this country great strides in this direction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
are being rapidly made), they would destroy the mental foundations
of all possibility of collective life of the higher type.</p>

<p>We touch here upon a question of policy of the highest importance.
There are, it seems to me, three distinct policies which
may be deliberately pursued, for the securing of the predominance of
public or social motives over egoistic motives. First, we may aim
at building up group life on the foundation of a system of discipline
which will result in more or less complete suppression of the egoistic
tendencies of individuals, the building up in them of habits of unquestioning
obedience to authority. I imagine that the Jesuit system
of education might fairly be taken as the most successful and
thorough-going application of this principle. The organisation of an
army of unwilling conscripts to fight for a foreign power must rest
on the same basis. Some group spirit no doubt will generally grow
up. But, though wonderful results have been obtained in this way,
the system has two great weaknesses. First, it seeks to repress
and destroy more than half of the powerful forces that move
men to action&mdash;namely, the egoistic motives in general&mdash;instead
of making use of them, directing them to social ends. Secondly,
it necessarily crushes individuality and therefore all capacity of
progress and further development in various directions; it results
in a rigidly conservative system without possibility of spontaneous
development.</p>

<p>The second system is that which aims at developing in all members
of the state or inclusive group a sentiment of devotion to the whole,
while suppressing the growth of sentiments for any minor groups
within the whole. This was the system of Plato&#8217;s <i>Republic</i> and is
essentially the collectivist ideal. It is the policy of those who would
suppress all sentimental groupings, all local loyalties and patriotisms,
in favour of the ideal of the brotherhood of man, the cosmopolitan
ideal. I have already pointed out one great weakness of this plan,&mdash;namely,
that this sentiment for the all-inclusive group cannot be
effectively developed save by way of development of the minor
group sentiments. And, though it may succeed with some persons,
there will always be many who cannot grasp the idea of the larger
whole sufficiently firmly and intelligently to make it the object of
any strong and enlightened sentiment of attachment; such persons
will be left on the purely egoistic level, whereas their energies might
have been effectively socialised by the development of some less
inclusive group consciousness.</p>

<p>Again, the smaller group is apt to call out a man&#8217;s energies more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
effectively, because he can see and foresee more clearly the effects
of his own actions on its behalf. Whereas the larger the group, the
more are the efforts of individuals and their effects obscured and lost
to view in vast movements of the collective life. That is to say, the
smaller groups harmonise more effectively than the larger groups
the purely egoistic and the altruistic motives (except of course in
the case of those few persons who can play leading parts in the life
of the larger group). For, though a man may be moved by his devotion
to the group to work for its welfare, he will work still more
energetically if, at the same time, he is able to achieve personal
distinction and acknowledgment, if the purely egoistic motives can
also find satisfaction in his activities. Hence this second policy also,
no matter how successful, fails to make the most of men, fails to
bring to the fullest exercise all their powers in a manner that will
promote the welfare of the whole. Thirdly, this system loses the
advantages of the healthy rivalry between groups within the whole;
which rivalry is a means to a great liberation of human energies.
These are the weaknesses of the over-centralised state, such as
modern France or the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Only the third policy can liberate and harmonise the energies of
men to the fullest extent; namely, that which aims at developing
in each individual a hierarchy of group sentiments in accordance
with the natural course of development.</p>

<p>One other virtue of the group spirit must be mentioned. Although
it tends to bring similar groups into keen rivalry and even into
violent conflict, the antagonism between men who are moved
to conflict by the group spirit is less bitter than that between
individuals who are brought into conflict by personal motives; for
the members of each group or party, though they may wish to
frustrate or even to destroy the other party as such, may remain
benevolent towards its members individually. And this is rendered
easier by the fact that the members of each group, recognising that
their antagonists are also moved by the group spirit, by loyalty and
devotion to the group, will sympathise with and respect their motives
far more readily and fully than they would, if they ascribed to their
opponents purely egoistic motives. This recognition, even though
it be not clearly formulated, softens the conflict and moderates the
hostile feelings that opposition inevitably arouses in men keenly
pursuing any end, especially one which they hold to be a public
good; in this way it renders possible that continuance of friendly
relations between members of bitterly opposed parties which has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
happily been the rule and at the same time the seeming anomaly of
English public life.</p>

<p>In our older educational system, and especially in the &#8216;public
schools&#8217; and older universities, the advantages and the importance
of developing the group spirit have long been practically recognised&mdash;&#8216;esprit
de corps&#8217; has been cultivated by the party system, by
rivalry of groups within the group; by forms, school-houses, colleges,
clubs, teams, games, and by keeping the honour and glory of the
school, college, or other unit, prominently before the minds of the
scholars in many effective ways. It is, I think, one of the gravest
defects of our primary system of education that it makes so little
provision for development of this kind; that, while it weakens the
family sentiment, it provides no effective substitute for it. Something
has been done in recent years to remedy this defect, notably the
fostering of the boy-scout movement; but every opportunity of
supplying this need should be seized by those who are responsible
for the direction of educational policy.</p>

<p>The importance of the group spirit may be illustrated by pointing
to those individuals and classes which are denied its benefits. The
tramp, the cosmopolitan globe-trotter, the outcast in general,
whether the detachment from group life be due to the disposition
or choice of the individual or to unfortunate circumstances, is apt
to show, only too clearly, how little man is able, standing alone, to
maintain a decent level of conduct and character. On a large scale
this is illustrated by the casteless classes in caste communities, and
especially by Eurasians of India and by other persons and classes of
mixed descent, who fail to identify themselves wholly with either
of the groups from which they derive their blood. The moral defects
of persons of these classes have often been deplored, and they have
usually been attributed to the mixture of widely different hereditary
strains. There is probably some truth in the view; but in general
the moral shortcomings of persons of these classes are chiefly due
to the fact that they do not fully share in the life of any group
having old established moral traditions and sentiments.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Summary of Principal Conditions of the Development
Of the Group Spirit</span></h4>

<p>We have seen that the group spirit plays a vastly important part
in raising men above the purely animal level of conduct, in extending
each man&#8217;s interests beyond the narrow circle of his own home and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
family, in inspiring him to efforts for the common good, in stimulating
him to postpone his private to public ends, in enabling the common
man to rise at times, as shown by a multitude of instances during
the Great War, to lofty heights of devotion and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>The development of the group spirit consists in two essential
processes, namely, the acquisition of knowledge of the group and
the formation of some sentiment of attachment to the group as such.
It is essential that the group shall be apprehended or conceived as
such by its members. Therefore the group spirit is favoured by whatever
tends to define the group, to mark it off distinctly from other
groups; by geographical boundaries; by peculiarities of skin-colour
or of physical type, of language, or accent, of dress, custom, or habit,
common to the members of the group; that is to say, by homogeneity
and distinctiveness of type within the group.</p>

<p>And, though definition of the group as such within the minds
of its members is the prime condition of the growth of the group
spirit, that spirit will be the more effective the fuller and truer
is the knowledge of the group in the minds of its members.
Just as individual self-knowledge favours self-direction and wisdom
of choice, so group self-knowledge must, if it is to be fully
effective, comprise not only the conception of the group as a
whole but also the fullest possible knowledge of the component
parts and individuals and an understanding of their relations to
one another. In this respect smallness and homogeneity of the group
are obviously favourable. But knowledge of the group, however
exact and widely diffused, is of itself of no effect, if there be not
also widely diffused in the members some sentiment of attachment
to the group. The prevailing group sentiment is almost inevitably
one of attachment. There are exceptional instances in which men
are compelled to act as members of a group which they hate or
despise, notably in some cases of compulsory military service and in
convict gangs; but it must be rare that, even under such conditions,
some sense of common interest, some fellow feeling for other members
in like distressing circumstances, does not lead to the growth of
some group spirit, provided only that the group has some continuity
and some homogeneity in essentials.</p>

<p>In all natural and spontaneously formed groups, the extension
of the self-regarding sentiment to the group is a normal and inevitable
process; and, like the self-regarding sentiment, the sentiment so
formed may range from an insane and incorrigible pride (as often
in the case of the family sentiment) to a decent self-respect that is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
perfectly compatible with a modest attitude and with reasonable
claims upon and regard for the interests of other groups.</p>

<p>The main difference between the self-regarding sentiment and
the developed group sentiment is that the latter commonly involves
an element of devotion to the group for its own sake and the sake
of one&#8217;s fellow members. That is to say, the group sentiment is a
synthesis of the self-regarding and the altruistic tendencies in which
they are harmonised to mutual support and re-enforcement: the
powerful egoistic impulses being sublimated to higher ends than the
promotion of the self&#8217;s welfare<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>Further, the group has, or may have, a greater continuity of
existence than the individual, both in the past and in the future;
and for this reason, and because also it includes the purely altruistic
tendency, the group sentiment is capable of idealisation in a high
degree and of yielding satisfactions far more enduring and profound
than the most refined self-sentiment.</p>

<p>Both knowledge of the group and the growth of the group sentiment
are greatly promoted by two processes, in the absence of
which the group spirit can attain only a very modest development.
These are free intercourse within the group and free intercourse
between the group and other groups. We shall have occasion to
discuss and illustrate them in later chapters.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>PECULIARITIES OF GROUPS OF VARIOUS TYPES</h4>

<p>We have discussed the psychology of the simple crowd or unorganised
group; and taking an army as an extreme and relatively
simple type of the highly organised group, we have used it to illustrate
the principal ways in which organisation of the group modifies its
collective life, raising it in many respects high above that of the
crowd.</p>

<p>I propose now to discuss very briefly the peculiarities of groups
of several types. Some classification of groups seems desirable as an
aid to the discovery of the general principles of collective life and
their application to the understanding of social life in general. It
seems impossible to discover any single principle of classification.
Almost every group that enjoys a greater continuity of existence
than the simple crowd partakes in some degree of qualities common
to all. But we may distinguish the most important qualities and
roughly classify groups according to the degrees in which they
exhibit them.</p>

<p>Apart from crowds, which, as we have seen, may be either
fortuitously gathered or brought together by some common purpose,
there are many simple groups which, though accidental in origin
(i.e. not brought together by common purpose or interest) and
remaining unorganised, yet present in simple and rudimentary form
some of the features of group life.</p>

<p>The persons seated in one compartment of a railway train
during a long journey may be entirely strangers to one another at
the outset; yet, even in the absence of conversation, they in the course
of some hours will begin to manifest some of the peculiarities of the
psychological group. To some extent they will have come to a mutual
understanding and adjustment; and, when a stranger adds himself
to their company, his entrance is felt to some extent as an intrusion
which at the least demands readjustments; he is regarded with
curious and to some extent hostile glances. If an outsider threatens
to encroach on the rights of one of the company, the others will
readily combine in defence of their member; and any little incident
affecting their one common interest (namely, punctual arrival of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
train at its destination) quickly reveals, and in doing so strengthens,
the bond of common feeling.</p>

<p>On a sea voyage the group spirit of the passenger ship attains
a greater development, by reason of the longer continuance of the
group, its more complete detachment and definition, the sense of
greater hazard affecting all alike, the sense of dependence on mutual
courtesy and good-will and sympathy for the comfort and enjoyment
of all. Very soon the experienced traveller, contrasting and
comparing this present company with those of previous voyages,
sums up its qualities and defects and lays his plans accordingly.
And by the time that an intermediate port is reached, where perhaps
the most &#8216;grumpy&#8217; and least entertaining member of the company
disembarks, even his departure is felt by the rest as a loss that
leaves a gap in the structure of the group.</p>

<p>Such fortuitous and ephemeral groups apart, all others may be
classed in the two great divisions of natural and artificial groups.</p>

<p>The natural groups again fall into two main classes which partly
coincide,&mdash;namely, those rooted in kinship and those determined by
geographical conditions. The family is the pure example of the
former; the population of a small island, the type of the latter kind.
The main difference is that the bonds of the kinship group are purely
or predominantly mental and therefore can, and commonly do,
remain effective in spite of all spatial separation and of all lack of
common purpose or of material benefits accruing from membership
in the group.</p>

<p>The artificial groups may be divided into three great classes, the
purposive, the customary or traditional, and the mixed; those of
the last kind combining the purposive and the traditional characters
in various proportions.</p>

<p>The purposive group is brought together and maintained by the
existence of a common purpose in the minds of all its members. It
is, in respect of efficiency, the highest type; for it is essentially self-conscious,
aware of its ends and of its own nature, and it deliberately
adopts an organisation suited to the attainment of those ends. The
simplest and purest type is the social club, a body of people who meet
together to satisfy the promptings of the gregarious instinct and to
enjoy the pleasures of group life. In the great majority of instances,
the social club adopts some form of recreation&mdash;debating, music,
chess, whist, football, tennis, cycling&mdash;the practice of which gives point
and definition to the activities of members and secures secondary
advantages. It is noteworthy that on this purely recreational
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
plane, clubs and societies of all sorts seek in almost all cases to
enhance the group consciousness and hence the satisfactions of group
life by entering into relations, generally relations of friendly rivalry,
but sometimes merely of affiliation and formal intercourse, with
other like groups. For not only is the group consciousness enriched
and strengthened by such intercourse; but, when the rival or communicating
groups, becoming aware of one another, become informally
or, more generally, formally allied to constitute a larger whole,
the consciousness of participation in this larger whole gratifies more
fully the gregarious impulse and enhances the sense of power and
confidence in each member of each constituent group. This seems
to be the main ground of that universal tendency to the formation
of ever more inclusive associations of clubs and societies, which,
overleaping even national boundaries and geographical and racial
divisions, has produced numerous world-wide associations.</p>

<p>Another very numerous class of strictly purposive groups is to
be found in the commercial companies. In these the group spirit
commonly remains at the lowest level; for the dominant motive is
individual financial gain, and the only common bond among the
shareholders is their interest in the management of the company so
far as it affects the private and individual end of each one. Group
self-knowledge, organisation, tradition, and group sentiment are all
at a minimum; accordingly the group remains incapable of effective
deliberation or action. It operates through its board of directors and
officers and, owing to its incapacity for group action, has to rely
upon the provisions of the Company Laws for the control of their
actions.</p>

<p>A third large class of purposive groups are the associations
formed for the furthering of some public end. Many such groups
are purely altruistic or philanthropic; but in the majority the
members hope to share in some degree in the public benefits for the
attainment of which the group is formed. In many such associations,
group life hardly rises above the low level of the commercial company;
the main difference being that, in virtue of the &#8216;disinterested&#8217; or
public-spirited nature of the dominant purpose, the members regard
one another and their executive officers with greater confidence and
sympathy; even though remaining personally unacquainted. Notable
instances of such associations, achieving great public ends, are &#8216;The
National Trust for the Preservation of Places of Natural Beauty or
Historic Interest,&#8217; and &#8216;The Public Footpaths Association.&#8217; Other
associations of this kind have something of the nature of a commercial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
company: e.g. &#8216;The First Garden City Company,&#8217; and &#8216;The Trust
Houses Company.&#8217; The peculiarity of these is that the motive of
financial gain is subordinated to, while co-operating with, the desire
for achievement of a public good, a benefit to the whole community in
which the members of the group share in an almost inappreciable
degree only. Such associations are very characteristic of the life of
this country; and it may be hoped that their multiplication and
development will prove to be one of the ameliorating factors
of the future, softening the asperities of commercial life, correcting
to some degree that narrowing of the sympathies, and preventing
that tendency to class antagonisms, which purely commercial associations
inevitably produce. The great co-operative societies seem
to have something of this character; for, although the dominant
motive of membership is probably in most cases private advantage,
yet membership brings with it some sense of participation in a great
movement for better social organisation, some sense of loyalty to
the group, some rudimentary group knowledge and group spirit, some
interest in and satisfaction in the prosperity of the group for its own
sake, over and above the strictly private interest of each member.
The introduction of various forms of profit sharing will give something
of this character to commercial companies.</p>

<p>The recent investments in government loans by millions of individuals,
acting in part from patriotic motives, must have a similar
tendency; and a similar effect on a large scale must be produced by
any nationalisation of industries, a fact which is one of the weightiest
grounds for desiring such nationalisation; though it remains uncertain
whether, when the scale of the association becomes so large
as to include the whole nation, the bulk of the citizens will be able
effectively to discern the identity of their public and private interests,
and whether, therefore, such nationalisation will greatly promote
that fusion or co-operation of public and private motives which is
the essential function and merit of the group spirit.</p>

<p>The most characteristic British group of the purposive type is
the association formed for some public or quasi-public end and
operating through a democratically elected committee or committees
and sub-committees. Such groups are the cradle of the representative
principle and the training ground of the democratic spirit, especially
of its deliberative and executive faculties. In them each member,
taking part in the election of the committee, delegates to them his
share of authority, but continues to exert control over them by his
vote upon reports of the committee and in the periodic re-election
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of its members. On this ground the citizens are trained to understand
the working of the representative principle; to yield to the opinion
of the majority on the choice of means, without ceasing loyally to
co-operate towards the common end; to observe the necessary rules
of procedure; to abide by group decisions; to influence group opinion
in debate, and in turn to be influenced by it and respect it; to differ
without enmity; to keep the common end in view, in spite of the
inevitable working of private and personal motives; to understand
the necessity for delegation, and to respect the organisation through
which alone the group raises itself above the level of the crowd.</p>

<p>Traditional groups of pure or nearly pure character are relatively
infrequent. Perhaps the castes of the Hindu world are, of all large
groups, those which most nearly approach the pure type. Traditional
grouping is characteristic of stagnant old established populations, of
which it is the basis of organisation and principal cement. No doubt
in almost every case the formation of the traditional group was in
some degree purposive; but the original purpose has generally been
lost sight of; myths and legends have grown up to explain the origin
of and give a fictitious purpose or &#8216;raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre&#8217; to the group. In the
absence of any definite practical purpose animating the group and
holding it together, its stability is secured and its tradition is re-enforced
and given a visible presentation by the development of
ritual. Of all the great groups among us the Free Masons perhaps
afford the best illustration of this type.</p>

<p>Far more important in the British world are the groups of the
mixed type, partly traditional and partly purposive, groups having
a long history and origins shrouded in the mists of antiquity, but
having some strong and more or less definite common purpose. Of
such groups the Christian Church is the greatest example. In the
Roman Church, whose history has been so little interrupted, tradition
attains its fullest power, and the regard for the past is strengthened
and supplemented by the prospect of an indefinitely prolonged
future directed towards the same ends. Its organisation has grown
gradually under the one continued overshadowing purpose, every
addition becoming embodied and established in the great tradition,
the strength of which is perpetually maintained by ritual. And this
traditional organisation is not only borne in the minds of each
generation of members of the Church, but, in an ever increasing
degree, has embodied itself in a material system of stone and glass
and metal and printed words; these constitute a visible and enduring
presentment which, though entirely disconnected and heterogeneous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in a merely material sense, yet provides fixed points in the whole
organisation, contributing immensely to its stability, and aiding
greatly in bringing home to the minds of its members the unity of
the whole group in the past, the present, and the future. Many
groups or sects having the same essential purpose as the Roman
Church have aimed to establish a tradition without the aid of such
material embodiments: but their ephemeral histories illustrate the
wisdom of the mother Church which, in building up her vast organisation,
has recognised the limitations and the frailties of the human
mind and has not scorned to adapt herself to them in order to overcome
them.</p>

<p>On a smaller scale our ancient universities and their colleges
illustrate the same great type of the partly traditional partly purposive
group, and the same great principles of collective life,&mdash;namely,
the stability derived from the continuity of tradition, from its careful
culture, and its partial embodiment in ritual and material structure.</p>

<p>An essential weakness of all such groups in a progressive community
is that tradition tends to overshadow purpose; hence every
such group tends towards the rigidity and relative futility of the
purely traditional group. Its organisation tends to set so rigidly that
it is incapable of adapting itself to the changing needs of the present
and the future; the maintenance of tradition, which is but a means
towards the acknowledged end, becomes an end in itself to which
the primary purpose of the whole is in danger of being subordinated.</p>

<p>The churches and the universities alike illustrate vividly the
principles of a group within a group. Each of the older universities
is a microcosm, a small model of the national life, and largely
to this fact is due its educational value as a place of residence.
Each college evokes a strong group spirit in all its members; and this
sentiment for the college, though it may and does in some minor
matters conflict with the sentiment for the university, is in the main
synthesised within this, and indeed is the chief factor in the strength
of that sentiment.</p>

<p>The group spirit of each college owes much of its strength to the
carefully fostered, but perfectly friendly, rivalry between the several
colleges in sports and studies and other activities. The close companionship
and emulation between a number of small communities
of similar constitution and purpose, each having a long and distinct
tradition as well as a clearly defined material habitat which embodies
and symbolises its traditions in a thousand different ways, has raised
the self-knowledge and sentiment of the groups to a high level. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
is well known that the few years spent in one of the colleges develops
in every member (with few exceptions) a sentiment of attachment
that persists through life and extends itself in some degree to every
other member, past, present and future; so that, in whatever part
of the world and under whatever circumstances two such men may
meet, the discovery of their common membership of the college at
once throws them into a friendly attitude towards each other and
prepares each to make disinterested efforts on behalf of the other.</p>

<p>The same is true in a less degree of the universities themselves.
Oxford and Cambridge have, partly in consequence of their proximity
and close intercourse, developed on closely parallel lines. They are
therefore so similar in constitution and aims as to be keen though
friendly rivals. This has been of great benefit to both, the self-knowledge
and group sentiment of each having been greatly promoted
by this close intercourse, rivalry, and reciprocal criticism.
And this rivalry has not prevented the growth of some sentiment
for the larger group constituted by the members of both universities,
each of whom is always ready to defend the common interests of
the larger group against the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Again, within each college there are numerous smaller groups,
each with its traditions and group spirit; and, so long as these groups
do not become too exclusive, do not absorb all the devotion of their
members, but leave each one free to join in the life of other minor
groups, their influence is good, the group spirit of each such minor
group contributing to the strength of the larger group sentiment and
enriching the spiritual life of the whole.</p>

<p>In the middle ages occupational groups were of great importance
and influence. They were of the mixed type, for most of
them, though essentially purposive, developed strong traditions; and
in their remote origins many of them were perhaps rather natural
than artificial formations. The violent changes of industrial life,
the development of the capitalist system and modern industrialism,
dislocated and largely destroyed these occupational groups to the
great detriment of social well-being. At the present time we see a
strong tendency to the growth of occupational groups of the purely
purposive type, which, lacking the guidance and conservative power
of old traditions, and depending for their strength largely upon the
identification of the material interests of each member with those
of the group, show a narrowness of outlook, a lack of stability and
internal cohesion, and a tendency to ignore the place and function
of the group in the whole community. They show, in short, a lack
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of the enlightened group spirit which only time, with increasing
experience and understanding of the nature and functions of
group life, can remedy. It may be hoped that with improved internal
organisation, with the growth of more insight into the mutual dependence
of the various groups on one another and on the whole
community, these groups, which at present seem to some observers
to threaten to destroy our society and to replace the rivalry of
nations by an even more dangerous rivalry of vast occupational
groups, may become organised within the structure of the whole
and play a part of the greatest value in the national life.</p>

<h4>THE NATIONAL MIND AND CHARACTER</h4>

<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">What is a Nation?</span></h4>

<p>Having studied the most general principles of the collective mental
life, as exemplified in the two extreme forms of the unorganised
crowd and the highly organised army, having briefly noted the
principal classes of groups that enjoy a collective mental life, and
having examined the nature and function of the group spirit in the
organisation of the group mind, we may now take up the study of
the most interesting, most complex and most important kind of
group mind, namely the mind of a nation-state<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to define more exactly the
popular notion of a nation. The word has sometimes been applied
to large groups of primitive folk that show evidence of close racial
affinity and similarity of customs, such as the Iroquois tribes of
North America, or the Hun invaders of medieval Europe. In popular
usage the word is more commonly restricted to the great nation-states
of modern times. It must be recognised that, since human
societies of present and past times present every conceivable variety
of composition and structure, it is impracticable to lay down any
strict definition and to classify populations as falling definitely
within or outside the class.</p>

<p>But, though we may not hope to lay down a definition which
shall clearly mark off the nation from all other human groups, we
may usefully define the nation-state or nation in the most highly
developed form that it has yet attained, and recognise that various
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
peoples partake of the nature of, or approach the type of, the nation
in so far as they exhibit something of its essential character.</p>

<p>It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that it is only in the
nation-state, or nation in the fullest sense of the word, that the
state becomes identical with the nation, and that this identification
has only been achieved in modern history by the growth among
a few peoples of representative institutions and the democratic
spirit.</p>

<p>In the work mentioned above Prof. Ramsay Muir writes&mdash;&#8220;What
do we mean by a Nation? It is obviously not the same thing as
a race, and not the same thing as a state. It may be provisionally
defined as a body of people who feel themselves to be naturally
linked together by certain affinities which are so strong and real
for them that they can live happily together, are dissatisfied when
disunited, and cannot tolerate subjection to peoples who do not
share these ties<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.&#8221; The provisional definition has the merit of
recognising that nationhood is essentially a mental condition and
must be defined in psychological terms. The author goes on to
inquire&mdash;&#8220;What are the ties of affinity which are necessary to
constitute a nation?&#8221; He then considers the following conditions:
(1) &#8220;occupation of a defined geographical area,&#8221; (2) &#8220;unity of race,&#8221;
(3) &#8220;unity of language,&#8221; (4) &#8220;unity of religion,&#8221; (5) &#8220;common subjection,
during a long stretch of time, to a firm and systematic
government,&#8221; (6) &#8220;community of economic interest, with the similarity
of occupations and outlook which it brings,&#8221; (7) &#8220;the possession
of a common tradition, a memory of sufferings endured and victories
won in common, expressed in song and legend, in the dear names
of great personalities that seem to embody in themselves the
character and ideals of the nation, in the names also of sacred places
wherein the national memory is enshrined.&#8221; Of the last he says
that it is &#8220;the most potent of all nation-moulding factors, the one
indispensable factor&#8221;; thus showing his sense of the essentially
psychological nature of nationhood. But of all the other six &#8216;factors&#8217;
enumerated, he shows that they are unessential. After reaching this
negative conclusion, that nationhood cannot be defined by any one
of these marks or factors, he writes: &#8220;Nationality, then, is an elusive
idea, difficult to define. It cannot be tested or analysed by formul&aelig;,
such as German professors love. Least of all must it be interpreted
by the brutal and childish doctrine of racialism. Its essence is a
sentiment, and in the last resort we can only say that a nation is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
a nation because its members passionately and unanimously believe
it to be so. But they can only believe it to be so if there exist among
them real and strong affinities; if they are not divided by any artificially
maintained separation between the mixed races from which
they are sprung; if they share a common basis of fundamental moral
ideas, such as are most easily implanted by common religious beliefs;
if they can glory in a common inheritance of tradition; and their
nationality will be all the stronger if to these sources of unity they
add a common language and literature and a common body of law.
If these ties, or the majority of them, are lacking, the assertion of
nationality cannot be made good. For, even if it be for the moment
shared by the whole people, as soon as they begin to try to enjoy
the freedom and unity which they claim in the name of nationality,
they will fall asunder, and their freedom will be their ruin.&#8221; In the
last sentence the author clearly shows that the conclusion at which
he seemed to have arrived, namely that &#8220;a nation is a nation
because its members passionately and unanimously believe it to be
so,&#8221; is untenable. At the present time there are populations
claiming the rights of nationality just upon this fallacious ground;
a fact which illustrates the importance of achieving some satisfactory
definition of nationhood. Indeed at the present moment,
when Europe is being remoulded by the Paris Conference, the
need for clear notions and some working definition of nationhood
has acquired a most urgent importance. For, as our author remarks,
&#8220;we say, loosely, that every nation has a <i>right</i> to freedom
and unity,&#8221; and the principle of &#8220;self-determination of nations&#8221;
has become almost universally accepted as a kind of moral axiom
of political justice; and this axiom is being applied to determine
the political boundaries of the world now and for all time. Yet
how can we hope to make a proper use of this principle, if we
cannot define a nation, if a modern historian, who has devoted
himself to the study of nationality, finds himself compelled in the
year 1917 to give up the attempt to define the meaning of the term
nation? For that is the issue of Prof. Ramsay Muir&#8217;s interesting
discussion. &#8220;We have not attained,&#8221; he confesses, &#8220;in this discussion
any very clear definition of nationality, or any very satisfactory test
of the validity of the claims put forward for national freedom. We
are not to base the doctrine of nationality upon abstract rights.
We must recognise that there is no single infallible test of what
constitutes a nation, unless it be the peoples&#8217; own conviction of their
nationhood, and even this may be mistaken or based upon inadequate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
grounds<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.&#8221; And the dire consequences of this failure are made
clear on the following page&mdash;&#8220;There seems no escape from the conclusion
that nationhood must mainly determine itself by conflict.
That conclusion appears to be the moral of the history of the national
idea in Europe.&#8221; Which is as much as to say that, when any
population declares itself to be a nation and claims the rights of
nationhood, the Statesmen of the Paris Conference are to reply&mdash;&#8220;We
do not know whether your claim is well-founded; for the
historians and political philosophers cannot tell us the meaning of
the word &#8216;nation.&#8217; Go to and fight, and, if you survive, we shall
recognise the &#8216;fait accompli&#8217; and hail you a Nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have dwelt at some length on this perplexity of the historian,
grappling with the task of defining nationhood, because it illustrates
so well a fact on which I wish to insist&mdash;namely, that it is not sufficient
for the historian and the political philosopher to be willing to
recognise the mental factors in the phenomena with which he deals.
It is necessary to recognise that these factors are of overwhelming
importance, and that they cannot be satisfactorily dealt with by
aid of the obscure and confused psychological concepts of popular
thought and speech. We must recognise these political problems
for what they truly are&mdash;namely, psychological through and through,
and only to be attacked with some hope of success if we call to our
aid all that psychological science can give us. This conclusion cannot
fail to be unpalatable to very many workers in this field; for it
implies that equipment for such work demands some additional
years of preparatory study. But, it may fairly be asked, if the
medical man must devote six years to the intensive study of the
human body, before he is permitted to practise upon it, and even
then without any scientific knowledge of the human mind, should
not he who would practise upon the body politic, in which not
merely the bodies but the minds of men interact in the most subtle
and complex fashion, prepare himself for his exalted task by an
even more extended course of study?</p>

<p>Prof. Ramsay Muir has the merit of recognising the essentially
psychological nature of his problem; for his provisional definition
(cited above) is wholly psychological, and he tells us that the essence
of nationality is a sentiment; but he reveals the inadequacy of his
psychological equipment by telling us in the same paragraph that
its essence is a belief, the belief that they are a nation, passionately
and unanimously held by the members of some group. If we look
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
again at the list of seven proposed marks of nationhood, we shall
see that they are rather of the nature of conditions favourable to
the growth of nationhood; and, as we shall find, this list may be
considerably enlarged. He comes nearest to the truth perhaps when
he says &#8220;its essence is a sentiment.&#8221; But he does not attempt to tell
us what is the nature of this sentiment, nor even what is its object.</p>

<p>We may imagine a group of people of considerable magnitude,
say the Mormons, or the Doukhobors, the Swedenborgians, or the
Christian Scientists, withdrawing themselves to some defined territory,
in order to form themselves into a nation; then, although each
of the seven conditions enumerated by Prof. Ramsay Muir might
be realised, and even though the community possessed the two
conditions described by him as the essence of nationality&mdash;namely,
a strong sentiment (presumably one of loyalty to the group) and a
passionate belief in its nationality&mdash;it would, in the absence of other
essential conditions, lamentably fall short of being a nation and would
suffer the fate indicated; namely &#8220;as soon as they begin to try to
enjoy the freedom and unity which they claim in the name of
nationality, they will fall asunder, and their freedom will be their
ruin<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>What, then, is the essential condition for lack of which any such
people would fall short of nationhood? What is the factor which
has escaped the analysis of Prof. Ramsay Muir? The answer must
be&mdash;organisation; not material organisation, but such mental organisation
as will render the group capable of effective group life, of
collective deliberation and collective volition. The answer to the
riddle of the definition of nationhood is to be found in the conception
of the group mind. A nation, we must say, is a people or population
enjoying some degree of political independence and possessed
of a national mind and character, and therefore capable of national
deliberation and national volition. In this and the succeeding chapters
we have to examine the nature of such national mind and character,
to give fuller meaning to these vague popular terms, and to study
the way in which various conditions of national life contribute to
their development.</p>

<p>Nationhood is, then, essentially a psychological conception. To
investigate the nature of national mind and character and to
examine the conditions that render possible the formation of the
national mind and tend to consolidate national character, these are
the crowning tasks of psychology.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me remind the reader at this point of the general sense of
the words mind and character. The two words really cover the same
content; when we speak of the individual mind or character, we
mean the organised system of mental or psychical forces which
expresses itself in the behaviour and the consciousness of the individual
man. Any such organised system has two aspects or sides
which, though intimately related, maybe considered abstractly as distinct&mdash;namely,
the intellectual or cognitive aspect and the volitional,
conative, or affective aspect. When we use the word &#8216;mind&#8217; in
speaking of any such system, we give prominence to its intellectual
side; when we say &#8216;character&#8217; we draw attention to its conative or
affective side. The group mind of a nation is a mind in the sense
that, like the mind of the individual, it is an organised system of
mental or psychical forces; and, like the individual mind, it also
has its intellectual and its affective sides or aspects. And this remains
true whether or no there be any truth in that notion of the &#8216;collective
consciousness&#8217; as a synthesis of minor consciousnesses which we have
provisionally rejected<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>; that is to say, we accept unreservedly the
notion of the collective mind, while suspending judgment upon the
notion of &#8216;collective consciousness,&#8217; until we shall find that this
hypothesis is, or is not, required for the interpretation of the facts.</p>

<p>It will be observed that we are getting far away from the old-fashioned
conception of psychology which limited its province to the
introspective description of the contents of the individual&#8217;s consciousness.
The wider conception of the science gives it new tasks
and new branches, of which the study of the national mind is one.
Like the main trunk of psychology and most of its branches, this
branch has to become an empirical science which shall take the place
of what has long been regarded as a branch of speculative philosophy
and pursued by the deductive <i>a priori</i> methods of philosophy. In
this case the branch of philosophy in question has generally been
called the Philosophy of History. It has been well said by Fouill&eacute;e
that the Philosophy of History of the past is related to the psychological
social science, that is now beginning to take shape, as alchemy
was related to chemistry, or astrology to astronomy. That is to say,
it was a realm of obscure and fanciful ideas, of sweeping and ill-based
assumptions and slipshod reasoning. It was an elaborate
attempt &#8220;to lay the intellect to rest on a pillow of obscure ideas.&#8221;>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
The task of scientific analysis and research was avoided by bringing
in, as the main explanatory principles or causal agencies, vaguely
conceived entities regarded as presiding over the development of
peoples&mdash;such entities as Providence, or the Destiny of nations, the
<i>Genius</i> of a people, or the Instinct of a nation, the Unconscious Soul
of a people, or the Spirit of the Age; and, when the problem was to
account for some great secular change, for example, some change
of national character, nothing was commoner than to appeal to <i>Time</i>
itself, and thus to make of this most empty of all abstractions a
directive agency and an all powerful cause of change. The strictly
national gods of various nations were popular conceptions of this
order; the gods who directly intervened in battles and enabled their
chosen peoples to smite their enemies hip and thigh so that not one
was left alive. Of this class the &#8220;good old German god&#8221; of the late
German emperor was, it may be hoped, the last example.</p>

<p>In a less crude form similar hypotheses of direct supernatural
intervention have been seriously maintained in modern times. Thus
the poet Schiller argued as follows&mdash;&#8220;The individuals of whom a
nation is composed are dominated by egoism, each seeking only his
own good, yet their actions somehow secure the good of the whole;
hence we must believe that the history of a people unrolls itself
beneath the glance of a wisdom that looks on from afar, that knows
how to control the ill-regulated caprices of liberty by the laws of
a directing necessity and to make the particular ends pursued by
individuals subservient to the unconscious realisation of a general
plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>In estimating the claims to consideration of a doctrine of this
sort, we must put aside its deleterious moral effects, the fact that
its acceptance would necessarily tend to weaken our sense of responsibility,
to paralyse altruistic effort, and to justify purely
egoistic conduct. We have to consider only its truth or probability
in the light of history. When we do that, it appears merely as a
fictitious solution of the larger problems of social science, a solution
which may relieve us of the necessity of intellectual effort, but which
brings no enlightenment and is supported by no serious argument.
The one argument advanced is a libel on human nature; for it
denies the reality and efficacy of the disinterested social efforts of
the leaders of humanity, to which its progress has been in the main
due; and it ignores the great mass of human activity due to the
group spirit with its fusion of egoistic and altruistic motives. Further,
it ignores the fact that the history of the world is not merely the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
history of the rise of nations, but rather of the perpetual rise and
<i>fall</i> of nations. When we are told that a power of this sort has
constantly intervened in the course of history, and that the rise of
peoples has been due to its guidance, we may fairly ask&mdash;Why has
it repeatedly withdrawn its support, just when civilisation has
achieved such a degree of development as might have rendered
possible the flowering of all the finer capacities of human nature and
the alleviation of the hard lot of the great mass of men? If the
contemplation of the course of history compelled us to believe that
such a power intervenes, we should certainly have to regard it as
a malign power that delights in mocking human efforts by first
encouraging and then bringing them to naught.</p>

<p>Very similar is the r&ocirc;le in history assigned by von Hartmann to
his &#8216;Unconscious.&#8217; &#8220;It carries away the peoples that it dominates,&#8221;
says von Hartmann, &#8220;with a demoniac power towards unknown
ends; it teaches them the way that they must take; though they
often believe themselves to be marching towards a goal very different
from that to which they are being conducted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others maintain that the great men of a nation, who are the
principal agents in moulding its destiny, are in some mystical sense
the products and expressions of the &#8216;unconscious soul&#8217; of the people,
that they are the means by which its ideas are realised, through
which they become effective; and they usually make the assertion,
altogether unwarranted by history, that the moment of great need
in the life of a people always produces a great man or hero to lead
the people through the crisis. That is, or may appear to be, true of
those peoples that have survived to pass into history. But what of
those peoples that have gone down, leaving no trace of all their
strivings, beyond some mounds of rubble, some few material monuments,
or some strange marks on brick or stone or rock?</p>

<p>All such assumptions are the very negation of science. We have
no right to appeal to such obscure and mystical powers, until by
prolonged effort we shall have exhausted the possibilities of understanding
and explanation in terms of known forces and conditions<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a number of writers have sought to interpret
the course of history and the rise and fall of nations in a more
scientific manner; but most of these have studied some one aspect
of national life, and have professed to find in that one aspect the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
key which shall unlock all doors and solve all problems. Thus
some, adopting the notion of a variety of human races, each endowed
with a certain peculiar and unalterable combination of qualities, seek
to explain all history by the aid of biological laws, especially the
Darwinian principles, as a struggle for survival between individuals
and between races. Others, like Karl Marx and Guizot, see in
economic conditions and the struggles between the social classes
within each nation, the all important factors. Others again, like
Montesquieu and to some extent Buckle and more recently Matteuzzi,
have seen in the influences of physical environment the key to the
understanding of differences of national character and history; while
others profess to have found it in differences of religious system,
or of the forms of government and systems of laws. Others again,
like le Bon<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, in a few dominant ideas which, they say, being possessed
by any nation (or possessing a nation) determine its character and
civilisation. All these are exaggerations of partial truths; and in
opposition to all of them it must be laid down that the understanding
of the <i>mind</i> of a nation is an indispensable foundation for the
interpretation of its history.</p>

<p>Just as there are two kinds of psychology of individuals, so there
are two kinds of psychology of peoples. There is the individual
psychology which is primarily descriptive, which is the biography
of persons, and whose aim is to impart an accurate conception of
the general tendencies of a person and of the course of his development.
And there is the psychology whose aim is to explain in general
terms the conduct of individual men in general by the aid of conceptions
and laws of general validity. The former, of course, was
developed much earlier than the latter, which is in the main of
quite modern growth. As this explanatory psychology develops, its
principles begin to find application in the sphere of biographical or
individual psychology, raising it also to the explanatory plane.</p>

<p>Just so there are two parallel kinds of psychology of peoples.
There is the descriptive psychology of the tendencies of particular
peoples, the biography of nations and peoples, which is what commonly
is meant by &#8216;history&#8217;; and there is the psychology which seeks
to explain in general terms how these tendencies arise, which seeks
the general laws of which these diverse national tendencies are the
outcome.</p>

<p>This last is the modern science which is beginning to take shape
and to undertake the task so inadequately dealt with by the so-called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Philosophy of History. It is essentially a branch, and by far the most
important part, of Group Psychology<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Now individual psychology
tends more and more to be a genetic psychology; because we do not
feel that we really understand the individual mind, until we know
how it has come to be what it is, until we know something of its
development and racial evolution. Just so the explanatory psychology
of peoples must be a genetic psychology. Here it differs
from individual psychology in that the distinction between individual
development and racial evolution disappears. For the national
mind is a continuous growth; it is not embodied in a temporal
succession of individuals, but in a single continuously evolving
organism.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we may with advantage consider separately (1) the
nature of the general conditions necessary to the existence and
operation of a national mind; (2) the processes of evolution by which
such minds are formed and their peculiarities acquired. I propose
to take up the former problem in the following chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>THE MIND OF A NATION</h4>

<p>We have prepared ourselves for the study of the national mind by
our preliminary examination of the two extreme types of collective
mental life, that of the quite unorganised group, the simple crowd, on
the one hand, that of a very highly organised group, the army, on
the other hand. We have seen that in the former type the collective
actions imply a collective mental life much inferior, both intellectually
and morally, to that of the average component individuals;
and that in the other type they imply a collective mental life and
capacities much superior to those of the average individual.</p>

<p>The mind of any nation occupies some intermediate position in
the scale of which these are the extreme types; and it differs from
both in being immensely more complex, and also in that the influence
of the past dominates and determines to a much greater extent the
mental life of the present.</p>

<p>The study we have already made of collective mental life will
enable us to understand what we mean, or ought to mean, when we
speak of national character. There are two senses in which this
phrase is used, and they are often confused. On the one hand, the
phrase may be used to denote the character of individuals who are
taken to be typical representatives or average specimens of their
nations. On the other hand, it may be taken to mean the character
of the nation as a collective whole or mind. These two things are
by no means the same; they are rather very different. We saw that
this was true in the case of the crowd and also of the army; and it is
true in a still higher degree of the nation than of any other social
aggregate, just because the influence of its past over its present is
greater than in any of the others. It is in the second and preferable
sense that Fouill&eacute;e uses this expression. He writes&mdash;&#8220;The
national character is not the simple sum of the individual characters.
In the bosom of a strongly organised nation, there are necessarily
produced reciprocal actions between the individuals which issue in
a general manner of feeling, thinking and willing very different from
that of the individuals existing in isolation, or even from the sum
or resultant of all the mental actions of isolated individuals. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
national character is not simply the average type which one would
obtain if one could imitate for minds the procedure adopted by Galton
in the case of faces and so obtain a collective or generic image. The
face which the process of compound photography produces exerts
no action and is not a cause; while the national spirit does exert an
effect which is different from all effects of individual minds; it is
capable of exerting a sort of pressure and a constraint upon the
individuals themselves; it is not only an effect, but is also in turn
a cause; it is not only fashioned by individuals, it fashions them
in turn. The average type of the Frenchman existing to-day, for
example, does not adequately represent the French national character,
because each people has a history, and ancient traditions,
and is composed, as it is said, of the dead even more than of the
living. The French national character resumes the physical and
social actions that have been taking place through centuries, independently
of the present generation, and imposes itself upon this
generation through all the national ideas, the national sentiments
and national institutions. It is the weight of the entire history to
which the individual is subjected in his relations with his fellow
citizens. Just, then, as the nation, as a certain social group, has an
existence different from (though not separable from) the existence
of the individuals, so the national character implies that particular
combination of mental forces of which the national life is the external
manifestation<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.&#8221; That is a precise and admirable statement of what
we are to understand by national mind and character.</p>

<p>We must now consider in turn the principal conditions of the
existence of highly developed national mind and character, and
first those which, as we have seen, are essential to all collective
mental life.</p>

<p>A certain degree of mental homogeneity of the group, some
similarity of mental constitution of the individuals composing it, is
the prime condition. The homogeneity essential to a nation may be
one of two kinds, native or acquired; both of these are usually
combined, but one of them predominates in some nations, the other
in others.</p>

<p>In considering racial or native homogeneity, we touch upon one
aspect of a much disputed question, the influence of race on national
character and history, in regard to which the greatest diversity of
opinion has prevailed and still prevails. A correct estimate of this
influence is of fundamental importance. I have stated elsewhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the view I take<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, but we must consider the question more fully here.
On the one hand are those who would explain all differences of
national character and action, all success and failure of nations, as
arising from racial composition. This view is the basis of much of
the ill-founded national pessimism which, before the Great War,
was widely prevalent among the peoples who speak the Romance
or Latin languages and who are falsely called by these pessimists the
Latin races. It was also the foundation of that overweening national
pride which has corrupted the German people and led them to
disgrace and disaster; for, following Gobineau<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and a host of his
disciples, among whom H. S. Chamberlain is perhaps the most
notorious, they had come to believe, against the most obvious
and abundant evidence, that they were the purest representatives of a
race from whose blood all great men and all good things have come, a
race fitted by native superiority to rule all the peoples of the earth<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, popular humanitarianism would regard all
men and all races as alike and equal in respect of native endowment;
and we have seen so distinguished a sociologist as Durkheim denying
any importance or influence to racial composition of a people. Many
others put aside all explanations based on racial differences as cheap
and meretricious means of avoiding difficulties. J. S. Mill, for
example, wrote &#8220;Of all vulgar modes of escaping from the consideration
of the effect of social and moral influences on the human mind,
the most vulgar is that of attributing the diversities of conduct and
character to inherent natural differences&#8221;; and Buckle, in his great
work on the <i>History of Civilisation</i>, quoted this remark with cordial
approval<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>Both these extreme views are false; the truth lies somewhere
in the midst between them. At the time when Mill and Buckle wrote,
biology and anthropology had not shown, as now they have, the
enormous power of heredity in determining individual character and
the great persistence of innate qualities through numberless generations.
Buckle especially overrated the power of physical environment,
and Mill the power of education and of social environment, to change
the innate qualities of a people; and it was this overestimation that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
led them, and leads others still, to underestimate the importance of
racial composition. There are involved in this dispute two theses
which are often confused together. When people speak of the
influence of &#8216;race&#8217; on national character and institutions, they may,
and sometimes do, mean by &#8216;race&#8217; the sum of innate inborn qualities
or tendencies of the people at any given point of history. On the
other hand, by influence of race they may mean the influence of
the prehistoric races which have entered into the social composition
of the nation&mdash;that is, those races from which its population is descended.
Some authors mean to deny importance to race in both
these senses; Buckle and Mill and Durkheim meant, I think, to deny
it in both, because they believed that human nature is very plastic
and easily moulded as regards its innate qualities by its environment;
they believed that, if only a system of institutions, especially educational
institutions, adapted to promote the intellectual and moral
development of each generation of a people, can be established
among it, then the influence of such institutions will so vastly
predominate over that of innate qualities that these become a
negligible quantity. From this it would follow that we should expect
to see any two or more populations endowed with similar institutions
form nations of similar character which will continue to develop
along similar lines, except in so far as minor unessential differences
of physical environment produce differences of modes of occupation,
dress, food and so forth.</p>

<p>This view of the insignificance of innate qualities was in harmony
with, and was determined by, the dominant psychological
doctrine of the time; the view which came down from Locke, according
to which the mind of the new-born individual is a <i>tabula
rasa</i>, entirely similar in all men, without specific tendencies and
peculiarities of any importance, on which individual experience
impresses itself, moulding all its development according to the
principle of the association of ideas.</p>

<p>This doctrine, explicitly or implicitly adopted, has played a
great part in determining British policy in its relations with British
dependencies and their populations, notably India. It is a striking
example of the way in which theory affects practice, and of the
danger of our profound indifference to theory; we are influenced by
it though we pretend to ignore it. It is well to make ourselves clear
as to what theories we hold, even if we do not allow our practice to
be governed by them exclusively.</p>

<p>There are commonly confused together, under the head of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
influence of race on national character, three problems which must
be disentangled.</p>

<p>(1) Are there differences of innate mental constitution between
the various branches of mankind?</p>

<p>(2) If there are such differences, are these important for national
life? Do they in any considerable degree determine national character?
Or are they capable of being swamped and submerged and
altogether over-ridden by the moulding influences brought to bear
by environment on each generation?</p>

<p>(3) If such innate differences exist, what degree of permanence
do they possess? Do they persist through thousands of years, in
spite of vast changes of physical or cultural conditions? Or may
they undergo considerable modification or complete transformation
in the course of a few generations?</p>

<p>These are questions of fundamental importance. And they admit
of no positive clean-cut answers at the present time. They offer vast
fields for research, and only when prolonged research shall have
been directed to them shall we be able to answer them positively.</p>

<p>In the past, since their importance could not be altogether overlooked,
it has been usual to dispose of them by dogmatically asserting
one extreme view and pouring scornful epithets upon the other
extreme view. A principal task for science in its present stage is to
define the questions clearly. It is not possible, perhaps, to keep them
quite separate; for, if there are considerable differences of innate
mental constitution, then their importance for national character
must depend greatly upon their degree of permanence; and, again,
there is the great difficulty of distinguishing between innate and
acquired mental qualities in any individual and still more in groups.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we may safely say that both extreme views in regard
to race, the positive and the negative, are gross exaggerations,
plausible only while we ignore one part of the evidence; the truth
lies in between somewhere.</p>

<p>There can, I think, be no reasonable doubt that there are great
differences between races, and that these may be, and in many cases
have been, persistent through thousands of generations.</p>

<p>The recognition that the mind of the human infant is not a
<i>tabula rasa</i>, but that its innate constitution comprises a number of
instincts, specifically directed tendencies to thought, feeling, and
action, prepares us to accept this view and gives us some basis for
the definition of these differences. Whether all differences can be
defined in such terms is a further problem. That they cannot be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
wholly defined in this way seems to be obvious, when we consider
how quite specialised idiosyncrasies are transmitted in families
through several generations, often with a leap across one generation,
peculiarities of taste and feeling, of aesthetic endowment and temperament,
abilities such as the musical, mathematical and artistic.</p>

<p>When we compare widely different peoples such as the Negro,
the White, and the Yellow, the fact of profound differences cannot
be overlooked. These differences cannot be ascribed to the action
of environment upon each generation. Perhaps the only differences
of this kind which at present are accurately measurable are those
of the size and form of the brain. The negro brain is decidedly
smaller than that of the white and yellow races. And there are small
but distinct differences of sensory endowment which are highly
significant. For, if there are racial differences in these most fundamental
and racially oldest endowments, we may expect still greater
differences in the later evolved powers of the mind; although these
are much more difficult to detect and define.</p>

<p>Still, the negro race wherever found does present certain specific
mental peculiarities roughly definable, especially the happy-go-lucky
disposition, the unrestrained emotional violence and responsiveness,
whether its representatives are found in tropic Africa, in the jungles
of Papua, or in the highly civilised conditions of American cities.</p>

<p>The Semitic stock again is one which, though widely scattered,
seems to present certain constant peculiarities. And among closely
allied branches of the white race of similar culture, we can hardly
refuse to recognise innate differences. Differences of temperament
are, perhaps, the clearest and the most generally recognised, even
between peoples of allied stock and similar civilisation. Who can
question that Irishmen in general are very different from Englishmen
in temperament, that they are less phlegmatic, more easily moved
to joy, or sorrow, or enthusiasm, more easily touched by poetry,
have a more varied and lively emotional experience? That this is
an innate racial difference seems clear; for it can be accounted for
in no other way, and it obtains in some degree between all communities
of similar racial stocks, in spite of similarities or differences
of history and of present conditions. For example, similar differences,
roughly definable as the difference between the so-called Celtic
temperament and the Anglo-Saxon, seem evidently to obtain between
the Breton and the Norman, who represent in the main the
same two stocks.</p>

<p>And, even in intellectual quality, there appear to be not only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
differences of degree, but also differences of kind, inexplicable
save as racial differences. The logical deductive tendencies of
the French intellect and the empirical inductive tendency of the
English, seem to be rooted in race; though here of course tradition
accumulates and accentuates such differences from generation
to generation.</p>

<p>But the best evidence of persistent innate differences is afforded
by differences and similarities expressed in national life which cannot
be accounted for in any other way. The innate differences and
peculiarities of individuals are largely obscured by these national
characteristics. And the more highly organised the collective life of
any people, the more clearly will it express their racial qualities.</p>

<p>The social environment in a developed nation is in harmony with
the individual innate tendencies, because in the main it is the natural
outcome and expression of those tendencies. For, throughout the
history of such a nation, the elements of its social environment&mdash;its
customs, beliefs, institutions, language, its culture in general&mdash;have
been slowly evolved under the steady pressure of the individual
innate tendencies, which in each succeeding generation are the same.
A part of this culture is of native origin; a part, in every European
nation probably by far the larger part, is of foreign origin, and has
been acquired by the acceptance of ideas and beliefs from without
its borders, by the copying of institutions, customs, arts, from
foreign models. In both cases the idea or custom or other cultural
element only becomes embodied in the national culture through
widespread or general imitation<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of elements of native origin, it is by imitation of the
individuals of original powers of thought or feeling that the element
becomes embodied in the national culture; in the case of foreign
elements, by imitation of foreign models, acceptance of foreign ideas,
through literature and personal contacts. In both cases, such general
imitation will only take place when the culture-element in question
is more or less congenial to the innate qualities of the bulk of
individuals. All other novel elements will be ignored, or will
fail to propagate themselves successfully; if they obtain a first
footing, they will fail to pass beyond the stage of fashion into
that of custom. And, when once accepted, the cultural element
will usually undergo modification in the direction of more complete
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
harmony with the innate tendencies; its less congenial features will
be allowed to die out, its more congenial will be accentuated from
generation to generation.</p>

<p>The social environment of any civilised people is, then, very
largely the result of a long continued process of selection, comparable
with the natural selection by which, according to the Darwinian
theory, animal species are evolved; a constant favouring of certain
elements, a constant rejection of others. We may in fact regard
each distinctive type of civilisation as a species, evolved largely by
selection; and the selective agency, which corresponds to and plays
a part analogous to the part of the physical environment of an animal
species, is the innate mental constitution of the people. The sum of
innate qualities is the environment of the culture-species, and it
effects a selection among all culture variations, determining the
survival and further evolution of some, the extermination of others.
And, just as animal species (especially men) modify their physical
environment in course of time, and also devise means of sheltering
themselves from its selective influence, so each national life, each
species of civilisation, modifies very gradually the innate qualities
of the people and builds up institutions which, the more firmly they
are established and the more fully they are elaborated, override and
prevent the more completely the direct influence of innate qualities
on national life.</p>

<p>These principles are illustrated, perhaps, most clearly by the
spread and modification of religious systems among peoples of
different races. Take the case of the Moslem religion, which has
gained acceptance among one-sixth of the population of the world
in historic and in fact recent times, and is still spreading. The leading
feature of this system is its acceptance of all that is and happens
as being the will of God, the act of an entirely arbitrary, inscrutable,
and absolutely powerful individual, before which men must simply
bow without question or criticism; it is characterised by its simplicity
and its fatalism. There seems good reason to believe that
the tendency to unquestioning obedience to authority is a strong
innate tendency of most Asiatics (except perhaps the Chinese and
their relatives), far stronger than in most individuals of European
peoples; for we see it expressed in many ways in their institutions
and history, both of those who are and those who are not Moslems<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>;
and Asiatic fatalism has, in fact, become proverbial. With the causes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
or origin of this innate quality we are not now concerned; but,
accepting it as a fact, we may note that it is among Asiatics that
Mohammedanism has secured the great mass of its converts; and that
in India, in spite of many minor features that are opposed to the
spirit of Hindooism, it continues to spread largely; while Christianity
makes but little progress. Buddhism on the other hand has almost
faded away, after an initial success in the country of its origin, but
has continued to gain adherents and has become the dominant
religion among the yellow peoples further east, in Burma, China,
Thibet, Japan. The Moslem religion, having been thus accepted in
virtue of the fact that its dominant tendency is in harmony with the
strong innate tendency to unquestioning submission to a supreme
will, then accentuates this tendency in all its converts, moulding
their political relations to the same type, so that all recognise one
earthly regent of God; and it has led to the almost complete suppression
of any spark of the spirit of inquiry and scepticism that
might otherwise display itself among these peoples.</p>

<p>Another good illustration of the fact is afforded by the distribution
of the two great divisions of the Christian religion in Western Europe.
Among all the disputes and uncertainties of the ethnographers about
the races of Europe, one fact stands out clearly&mdash;namely, that we can
distinguish a race of northerly distribution and origin, characterised
physically by fair colour of hair and skin and eyes, by tall stature
and dolichocephaly (i.e. long shape of head) and mentally by great
independence of character, individual initiative, and tenacity of
will. Many names have been used to denote this type, but the
usefulness of most of them has been spoilt through their application
to denote linguistic groups (e.g. Indo-Germanic, Aryan), and by
the false assumption that linguistic groups are racial groups. Hence
recently the term <i>Homo Europaeus</i>, first applied by Linnaeus to
this type, has come into favour; and perhaps it is the best term to
use, since this type seems to be exclusively European. It is also
called the Nordic type.</p>

<p>The rest of the population of Europe, with the exception of some
peoples in the extreme north and east of partly mongoloid or yellow
racial origin, seems to be chiefly derived from two stocks. Of these,
the one type, which occupies chiefly the central regions, is most
commonly denoted by the name <i>Homo Alpinus</i>; the other, chiefly
in the south, by the name <i>Homo Mediterraneus</i>. Both are of dark
or brunette complexion and the principal physical difference between
them is that the former, <i>H. Alpinus</i>, has a short broad head (i.e.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
is brachycephalic) and also is of short stature; while the latter,
<i>H. Mediterraneus</i>, is long-headed like the northern type and is
perhaps taller than <i>H. Alpinus</i>. Mentally both these differ from the
northern or European type in having less independence and initiative,
a greater tendency to rely upon and seek guidance from authority<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.
Now we find that the distribution of the Protestant variety of
Christianity coincides very nearly with the regions in which the fair
type predominates; while in all other regions the Roman Catholic
or Greek orthodox churches hold undisputed sway. North and South
Germany illustrate the point. And Motley&#8217;s account of the Netherlands
shows how closely the line between Protestant Holland and
Roman Catholic Belgium coincides with the line of racial division.
We may note also that &#8216;Celts&#8217; of Ireland and Scotland early proved
the superior strength of their religious tendencies by sending missionaries
to England.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to hold that this coincidence is fortuitous.
It is clearly due to the assimilation of the form of the religious and
ecclesiastical system to the innate tendencies of the people. The
northern peoples have given the system a turn compatible with the
independence of spirit which is their leading racial quality; and
among ourselves the tendency is apt to be pushed to an anarchical
extreme in the rise of numerous small peculiar sects; this we must
connect with the fact that the English represent in greatest purity
the most independent branch of the Northern race.</p>

<p>The peoples among whom the other racial elements predominate
have developed and maintained a religion of authority. And it is
clear how, this differentiation having been achieved, either form of
religion favours and accentuates in the peoples among whom it has
become established the innate tendencies that have shaped it. The
religion of authority tends, both by its general teachings and by the
deliberate efforts of its official representatives, to suppress the spirit
of independent thought and inquiry and action; the Protestant
religion, relatively at least, favours the development of the independent
tendencies of individuals. This is not to say that any
individual is a Mohammedan or a Protestant, because he belongs to
this or that race; that would be a parody of my statement. The
form of each man&#8217;s religious belief is, in the vast majority of
cases, determined for him by the fact of his growing up within a
community in which that form of belief prevails. My thesis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
is that in the main the racial qualities of each community have
played a great part in determining which form of belief it shall
accept. If the reader will reflect how, at the time of the Reformation,
various communities hung for a time in the balance, he will see that
the innate differences we have noted may well have played the
determining r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>The same facts are illustrated by the political life of the European
peoples. Only those among whom the northern race is predominant
have developed individualistic forms of political and social organisation.
Among the rest there appears clearly the tendency to rely
upon the supreme authority of the state and to look to it for all
initiative and guidance, a tendency to centralised and paternal
administration; and this is the same, whether the external form of
the political organisation be a monarchy or a republic. Thus France,
in becoming a republic, did not overthrow the centralised system
perfected by Henry IV, Louis XIV, Richelieu and Napoleon; for
that system was congenial to the innate qualities of the mass of the
people. It is clear that the centralised and therefore rigid system of
government tends to accentuate, among the people subjected to it,
their tendency to rely on authority and to repress individual
initiative; while the other form, such as obtains in this country and
still more in the United States of America, tends to the development
of the initiative and independence of individuals, giving them free
scope and throwing them upon their own resources. Among any
people, an institution or other cultural element that has had a
history of this kind will, then, cause a great development in
the mass of individuals of just those innate or racial tendencies of
which it is itself the slowly accumulated result or product.</p>

<p>If a nation is composed from stocks not too diverse, or if the
original stocks have fused by intercrossing and have produced a
fairly homogeneous people; and if this nation has enjoyed a long
period of natural evolution undisturbed by violent influences from
outside, conquests or invasions or immigrations on a great scale;
then the social environment will have been brought in the main into
harmony with the innate qualities of the people, and it will mould
the individuals of each generation very strongly, accentuating and
confirming those innate tendencies. This for two reasons. First, the
social environment will be strongly organised and homogeneous;
that is to say, the various elements, the beliefs, customs, institutions,
and arts that go to compose it, will be in harmony with one another
and of strongly marked character; and they will be almost universally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
accepted by that people as above criticism. Secondly, the institutions
and customs have not to fight against the innate tendencies
of the people in the formation of the adult minds, but co-operate
harmoniously with them.</p>

<p>Now, when authors dispute over the question of the influence of
race in determining the nation, they usually fail to distinguish
clearly between the direct effects and the indirect effects of racial
qualities.</p>

<p>Those who, like Mill, attribute to the social environment unlimited
power of moulding individuals and who regard the influence
of race as insignificant, are misled by the contemplation of such
nations as we have been considering, the class of which our own is
the most notable example, nations in which a strongly organised
social environment makes in the direction of the innate tendencies.
They overlook the fact that in any such nation the social environment,
the body of institutions and traditions, is in the main the
outcome and expression of these innate tendencies; they fail to see
that the racial tendencies exert their strongest influence on national
thought and action by means of the institutions, customs, and
traditions on the growth of which they have exerted a constant
directive pressure throughout many generations. In order to
realise fully the influence of race, we must consider peoples whose
culture and much else that enters into their social environment has
been impressed upon them from without. We then see how
little the social environment can accomplish in the moulding of a
people, when it is not congenial to and in harmony with the racial
tendencies.</p>

<p>The modern world contains certain instructive instances, of
which Hayti is perhaps the most striking. There a circumscribed
population of negro race has had a political and social and religious
organisation and the elements of higher culture impressed upon it
by Europeans, in the belief that it would be possible to construct
a social environment which would mould the people. France, at a
time of revolutionary enthusiasm for liberty, equality, and fraternity,
withdrew from the island and granted the people self-government.
The consequence has been a rapid relapse into barbarism and
savagery of the worst kinds<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>It was the ignoring of the importance of race and the overestimation
of the moulding influence of culture and institutions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
eloquently voiced by Lord Macaulay, that led England eighty years
ago to set out on the task of endowing the millions of India with
British culture and institutions. The task has been pursued in a
half-hearted manner only; but already we see some of the incongruity
of the results of these efforts; and the best observers assure us that,
were the task accomplished and the reins of a representative government
left in native hands, it would be but a few years before the
whole country would be reduced to a chaotic anarchic condition no
better than that in which we found it. Others go further and assert
with some plausibility that Western culture is positively injurious
to the intellect and moral nature of Indians<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Philippines the Americans seem to have applied similar
mistaken ideas in a reckless fashion in the first years of their administration;
with the result that, according to some accounts, they were
in a fair way to plunge those islands into poverty and debt and
chronic rebellion, while failing to secure affection, trust, or respect
for themselves.</p>

<p>We must conclude, then, that innate mental constitution, and
therefore race, is of fundamental importance in determining national
character, not so much directly as indirectly; for it gives a constant
bias to the evolution of the social environment, and, through it,
moulds the individuals of each generation. It will help to make
clear the influence of innate qualities, if, by an effort of imagination,
we suppose every English child to have been exchanged at
birth for an infant of some other nation (say the French) during
some fifty years. At the end of that period the English nation
would be composed of individuals of purely French origin or blood;
it would have the innate qualities of the present French nation;
and the French nation would be, in the same sense, English.
What would be the effect? Presumably things would go on much
as before for a time. There would be no sudden transformation of
our language, our laws, our religious or political institutions; and
those who make little of the influence of race might point to this
result as a convincing demonstration of the truth of their view.
But gradually, we must suppose, certain changes would appear;
in the course of perhaps a century there would be an appreciable
assimilation of English institutions to those of France at the present
day, for example, the Roman Catholic religion would gain in strength
at the cost of the Protestant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>This view has been challenged and described as an extreme view<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.
But it is not. Both extreme opposite views continue to be maintained
just because the importance of the indirect cumulative effect
of innate qualities on culture is ignored. The innate qualities are of
great importance, but only in the course of centuries can they exert
their full effect on culture.</p>

<p>If then innate qualities have this importance, in what degree
are they permanent? Here again two extreme views remain opposed
to one another. Even as regards physical qualities this is still the
case; and the problem is much more difficult and at the same
time infinitely more important as regards mental qualities. One
reason for the belittling of innate qualities by Mill and Buckle, and
for their overweening confidence in the power of institutions and
environment, was the opinion generally prevailing in their time that,
in so far as racial peculiarities exist, they can be modified and transformed
in a few generations by physical and social environment.</p>

<p>But, when, under the influence of Welshman&#8217;s theories, the
majority of biologists came to the conclusion that acquired qualities
are not transmitted, the position of the &#8216;race theorisers&#8217; was immensely
strengthened. For selection, natural or social or artificial,
remained as the only recognised cause of change of racial qualities;
and, since it is clear that the development of civilisation tends to
bring to an end the operation of natural selection, owing to the more
efficient shielding of the weaker by the stronger members of societies,
and since no other form of selection seems to have operated forcibly
to change race qualities, it was inferred that race qualities endure
throughout long ages with very little change.</p>

<p>Another revolution of opinion has had a similar effect. One of
the old assumptions which seemed to justify the belief in rapid
modifiability of race qualities was that the difference of culture
between ourselves and our savage ancestors corresponds to, and is the
expression of, an almost equally great difference of innate capacities,
intellectual and moral. But this was in the main a misunderstanding.
One well established fact suffices to show its improbability&mdash;namely,
the larger size of the brains of Pal&aelig;olithic men as
compared with our own. Our superiority of civilisation is due to
slow accumulation, each generation adding comparatively little to
the mass of intellectual and moral tradition which it inherits and
passes on to later coming generations. In so far as differences of
cultural level are associated with differences of level of innate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
intellectual and moral qualities, cultural superiority must be
regarded as the effect, rather than the cause, of innate mental
superiority. There are strong grounds for holding that, in so far as
Europeans are innately superior to negroes, that superiority was
achieved not by means of, and in the process of, the development
of, civilisation; but rather before civilisation began; and that the
principal mental differences of the various human stocks were, like
their principal physical differences, produced in the course of the
immensely long ages of human life that preceded the dawn of civilisation,
or at any rate of history, ages compared with which the
historic period is but a very brief span.</p>

<p>This view&mdash;namely, that there has been no great change, and
certainly no great increase, of the mental powers of men during the
historic period&mdash;was forcibly maintained by Dr A. R. Wallace<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.
Wallace pointed to the pyramids of Egypt and other great
achievements of earlier civilisations, such as writing, as evidence of
the highly developed intellectual powers of men thousands of years
before the Christian era. He concluded that the men of the early
stone age were probably our equals, intellectually and morally, in
respect to innate qualities.</p>

<p>If, then, so little change of man&#8217;s mental constitution has been
produced in the course of many thousand years, even though the
growth of civilisation has so profoundly modified his mode of life
and the nature of his pursuits, that is good evidence of the great
persistency of racial mental qualities. But we have more direct
evidence of their persistence. As Wallace points out, the negro and
the yellow races are scattered over many parts of the earth, and,
though these regions present great diversities of physical environment,
men of either of the two races everywhere present the same
mental peculiarities or strong similarities, for example, the Papuan
and African and American negroes. And the characteristic differences
between the two races are not diminished even where, as
in the islands of the far East, they have been subjected to the same
physical environment and modes of life for long periods of time.
In the eastern Archipelago, Papuans and Malayans occupying the
same or adjoining islands are cited by Wallace as illustrating the
persistence of racial mental differences; and I can bear out his
remarks from my own observations in that region.</p>

<p>But we must beware of excess in the direction of the unalterability
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of race. The dogma of the non-transmissibility of acquired qualities
is by no means established; it seems not improbable that mental
acquisitions are so transmitted in some degree, though with only
very slight effect in each generation. Even now, when the difficulties
of the principle of transmission of acquired qualities are generally
understood, almost all those who deal with the problem of the
genesis of mental and physical peculiarities of races find themselves
driven to postulate the principle in order to explain the facts. And
this in itself constitutes evidence of a certain value in support of
the validity of the principle.</p>

<p>Again, we must beware of assuming that there are no selective
processes operating among us. Although natural selection may be
almost inoperative, there may well be at work other forms of selection,
social selections; and these are specially powerful amongst
populations of blended stocks.</p>

<p>Summing up on the durability of racial peculiarities, we may say
that racial qualities are extremely persistent; but that, nevertheless,
they are subject to slow modifications when the conditions of life are
greatly changed, as by emigration, or by changes of climate, or by
social revolutions, and especially among populations of mixed origin.</p>

<p>To return now to the question of mental homogeneity of a population
as a condition of national character and collective mental life.
Purity of race is the most obvious condition of such homogeneity;
but few, if any, nations that have attained any high level of civilisation
have been racially homogeneous; probably for the simple reason
that the civilisation of such a nation would crystallise at an early
stage into rigid forms which would render further progress impossible.
This has been the fate of most civilisations of the past; as Walter
Bagehot put it, their cake of custom has so hardened as to become
brittle, incapable of partial modification and growth, so that, like
a crystal, it must either resist completely every modifying influence
or be shattered irretrievably<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly none of the European nations are racially homogeneous.
Nevertheless, some of them approach homogeneity of innate qualities,
or, rather, the degree of heterogeneity is much less in some than
in others. Consider the case of England. Before the Anglo-Saxon
invasion the population consisted in all probability of a mixture of
the northern fair race with a darker race, probably that of <i>H. Mediterraneus</i>,
in some proportion that we cannot determine, with small
islands of <i>H. Alpinus</i> or of stocks formed by an earlier blending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of this with the Nordic race. The Anglo-Saxon invasion brought
great numbers of the pure representatives of the Northern race
of closely allied stocks; and these did not confine themselves
to any one region, but, entering at many points of the south
and east coasts, diffused themselves throughout almost all England,
imposing themselves as masters upon those Britons whom they
did not drive out. Ever since that time a crossing of the stocks
has been going on freely, little hindered by differences of area,
language, law, or custom. And, with the exception of small numbers
of the Northern stock, Danes and Normans, the population has not
received any considerable additions since the Saxon invasion.</p>

<p>Now it has been shown by a simple calculation that, given three
generations to the century, each one of us might claim ten million
ancestors in the year 1000 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>; while in the fifth century, when this
process of intermarriage began, the number would be enormous,
some thousands of millions; that is, if consanguine marriages had
never taken place. These figures make it clear that, in any mixed
population in which intermarriage takes place freely, the two or
more stocks must, after a comparatively brief period of time, become
thoroughly blended, on one condition&mdash;namely, that the cross between
the pure stocks is a stable stock, fertile <i>inter se</i> and with both
the parent stocks. There seems to be no doubt that this was the case
with the British and the Anglo-Saxon stocks, and that the English
form now a stable new subrace, or secondary race, in which the
qualities of the northern race predominate. The subrace may be
regarded as innately homogeneous in fairly high degree; not so
homogeneous as a people of unmixed racial origin, or one formed
by a blending of more remote date, but more so than most of the
European nations. This is the sense in which we must understand
the word race, in discussing the influence of race upon national
character.</p>

<p>In most of the European countries the original mixture of races
has been greater and the degree of blending less intimate. Thus
France has the three stocks, <i>H. Europaeus</i>, <i>Alpinus</i>, <i>Mediterraneus</i>,
all largely represented; but they have remained in some degree
geographically separated in three belts running east and west<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.
Hence there are greater innate mental differences between Frenchmen
than between Englishmen. Nevertheless the strength of the Roman
civilisation of Gaul sufficed to abolish differences of language and
institutions and to assimilate the later coming Northmen, Franks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and Normans; while the centralised system of administration, established
in accordance with the innate tendencies of the major part
of the population, has completed the work of a long series of national
wars, and has produced a firmly united nation, bound by common
traditions and moulded by common institutions. The greater
centralisation of France seems to have compensated for the less
degree of innate uniformity, so that the French people is hardly, if
at all, less truly a nation than our own.</p>

<p>In our own nation one racial cleft still remains. The Irish have
never undergone that intimate mixture and blending with the
Anglo-Saxon stock which has produced the English subrace; and
so they remain an element which seriously disturbs the harmony
of the national mind. And the same is perhaps true in a less degree
of the Welsh people. On the other hand, the Scottish people, although
they enjoyed their independent system of government for much
longer periods than the Irish and Welsh and have a system of laws
and customs differing in many respects from the English, and indeed
may be said to have achieved a considerable degree of independent
nationhood, have nevertheless become thoroughly incorporated in
the British nation; for in the main mass of the Scotch the same
Northern race is the greatly predominant element.</p>

<p>But it is not till we consider such a country as Austria-Hungary
that we see the full importance of homogeneity of a people for the
development of a national mind. There several races and subraces,
one at least with a strong yellow strain, are grouped together under
one flag; but they remain separated by language and by distribution
and by tradition, and, therefore, are but little mixed and still less
blended. Under such conditions a national mind cannot be formed.
The elements of different racial stock threaten to fall apart at any
moment<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>Going further afield, contrast India with China, two regions
geographically comparable in area and in density of population and
in other ways. The population of China is the most racially homogeneous
of all large populations in the world. Hence an extreme
uniformity of culture and social environment, which still further
accentuates the uniformity of mental type. Hence, in spite of the
imperfection of means of communication, we find great political
stability and a considerable degree of national feeling, likely to be
followed before long by harmonious national thought and action on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the part of this vast nation. The one great distracting and disturbing
factor in the life of China has been the intrusion of the Manchus, a
people of somewhat different race and traditions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, India is peopled by many different stocks,
and, although these are geographically much mixed, they are but
very little blended, owing to the prevalence from early times
of the caste system. The light coloured intellectual Brahman lives
side by side with small black folk, as different physically and
mentally as the Englishman and the Hottentot; and there are also
large numbers of other widely differing racial stocks, including some
of yellow race. Hence an extreme diversity of social environment,
save in the case of the Moslem converts, who, however, being
scattered among the rest, do but increase the endless variety of
custom, creed, and social environment. Hence the people of India
have never been bound together in the slightest degree, save purely
externally by the power of foreign conquerors, the Moguls and the
British; and hence, even though nations have begun at various
times to take form in various areas, as e.g. the Sikh nation, they
have never achieved any high degree of permanence and stability
and are restricted in area and numbers.</p>

<p>Now let us consider for a moment an apparent exception from
the conclusion to which the foregoing argument seems to point&mdash;namely,
that homogeneity of innate qualities is the prime condition
of a developed and harmonious national life.</p>

<p>The most striking exception is afforded by the people of the
United States of America, or the American nation. There we see
a great area populated by immigrants from every part and race of
Europe in times so recent that, although they are pretty well mixed,
they are but little blended by crossing; a considerable part of the
population still consisting of actual immigrants and their children.
Here, then, there can be no question of any homogeneity as regards
innate mental qualities. Nevertheless, the people is truly a nation
and, perhaps, further advanced in the evolution of national consciousness,
thought, and action than many other of the civilised peoples.
This we must attribute to homogeneity of mental qualities which
is in the main not innate but acquired, a uniformity of acquired
qualities, especially of all those that are most important for national
life.</p>

<p>Following M&uuml;nsterberg&#8217;s recent account of <i>The Psychology of
the American People</i> we may recognise as individual characteristics,
almost universally diffused, a spirit of self-direction and self
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
confidence, of independence and initiative of a degree unknown
elsewhere, a marvellous optimism or hopefulness both in private
and public affairs, a great seriousness tinged with religion, a
humourousness, an interest in the welfare of society, a high degree
of self-respect, and a pride and confidence in the present and still
more in the future of the nation; an intense activity and a great
desire for self-improvement; a truly democratic spirit which regards
all men (or rather all <i>white</i> men) as essentially or potentially equal,
and a complete intolerance of caste.</p>

<p>Such high degree of acquired homogeneity of individual qualities
seems to be due in about equal parts to uniformity of social and of
physical environment, both of which make strongly in the same
direction. The physical environment consists in a great and rich
territory, still only partially developed, a fairly uniform climate,
and a uniformity of the physical products of human labour resulting
from the immense development of the means of communication. The
importance of the physical uniformity we may realize on reflecting
that the one great divergence of physical conditions, the sub-tropical
climate of the southern States, gave rise to the one great and
dangerous division of the people which for a time threatened the harmonious
development of the national life; that is to say, the civil war
was due to the divergence of the social system and economic interests
of the southern States resulting from their sub-tropical climate.</p>

<p>The uniformity of social environment we must ascribe, firstly and
chiefly, to the fortunate circumstance that the first immigrants were
men of one well marked and highly superior type, men who possessed
in the fullest measure the independence of character and the initiative
of the fair northern race, and who firmly established the superior social
environment of individualistic type that had been gradually evolved
in England. Secondly, to the fact that the peopling of the whole
country has taken place by diffusion from this strongly organised
initial society; its institutions and ideas, especially its language,
its political freedom, its social seriousness, being carried everywhere.
Thirdly, to the fact that the country was just such as to give the
greatest scope to, and so to develop, these innate tendencies of the
earliest settlers and their successors. Fourthly, to the fact that the
great diffusion of the population of mixed origin has only taken
place since the means of communication have become very highly
developed. Consider, as one example of the effects of the ease of
communication between all parts, the influence of the American
Sunday newspapers. These papers are read on an enormous scale
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
all over the continent; and the bulk of the contents of those published
in different places is identical, being prepared and printed in New
York, or other great city, and then sent out to be blended with
a little local matter in each centre of publication; thus every Sunday
morning vast numbers are reading the same stuff. Lastly, it must
be added, it is largely due to the fact that in the main the population
has been recruited by those elements of different European
peoples who shared in some degree the leading tendencies of the
American character, independence, initiative, energy and hopefulness;
for it is only such people who will tear themselves from their places
in an old civilisation and face the unknown possibilities of a distant
continent. In spite of an increasing proportion of emigrants of a
rather unlike type from south-eastern Europe, there seems good
ground for hope that these factors will continue to secure a
sufficient uniformity of acquired qualities, until the diverse elements
shall have been fused by intermarriage to a new and stable subrace,
innately homogeneous.</p>

<p>The Americans are, then, no exception to the rule that the
evolution of a national mind presupposes a certain considerable
degree of homogeneity of mental qualities among the individuals
of which the nation is composed. They merely show that, under
peculiarly favourable physical and social conditions, a sufficient
degree of such homogeneity may perhaps be secured in spite of considerable
racial heterogeneity. But the favourable issue of the vast
experiment is not yet completely assured.</p>

<p>There remains in the American people one great section of the
population, namely the negroes and the men of partly negro descent,
whose innate qualities, mental and physical, are so different from those
of the rest of the population, that it seems to be incapable of absorption
into the nation. This section remains within the nation as a
foreign body which it can neither absorb nor extrude and which is
a perpetual disturber and menace to the national life. The only hope
of solving this difficult problem seems to lie in the possibility of
territorial segregation of the coloured population in an area in which
it might, with assistance from the American people, form an independent
nation. At present it illustrates in the most forcible manner
the thesis of this chapter.</p>

<p>The geographical peculiarities of the country inhabited by a
nation may greatly favour, or may make against, homogeneity, in
so far as this depends on acquired interests and sentiments.</p>

<p>The division of the territory occupied by a nation by any physical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
barrier makes against homogeneity and therefore against national
unity; whereas absence of internal barriers and the presence of well
marked natural boundaries afford conditions the most favourable
to homogeneity.</p>

<p>Almost all the great and stable nations have occupied well-defined
natural territories. In Great Britain and Japan the national
spirit is perhaps more developed than elsewhere. How much does
Great Britain or Japan owe this to the insular character of its territory,
which from early days has sharply marked off the people from
all others, making of them a well-defined and closed group, within
which free intermarriage has given homogeneity of innate qualities,
and within which a national culture has grown up undisturbed; so
that by mental and physical type, and by language, religion, tradition
and sentiment, the people are sharply marked off from all others,
and assimilated to one another!</p>

<p>A unitary well-defined territory of well marked and fairly uniform
character tends to national unity, not only through making the
community a relatively closed one, but also by aiding the imagination
to grasp the idea of the nation and offering a common object to the
affections and sentiments of the people.</p>

<p>Contrast in this respect the physical characters of England and
Germany. The boundaries of the latter are almost everywhere
artificial and arbitrary and have fluctuated greatly. It would be
impossible for a poet to write of Germany as Shakespeare wrote of
England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">This fortress built by Nature for herself</div>
<div class="line">Against infection and the hand of war;</div>
<div class="line">This happy breed of men, this little world,</div>
<div class="line">This precious stone set in the silver sea,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and all the rest of that splendid passage. France, Spain, Italy,
Greece, Denmark, Scandinavia, are all more fortunate than Germany
or Austria in this respect; and the lack of such natural boundaries
has been in the past, and threatens to be in the future, a source of
weakness to the German nation. We may, I think, not improbably
attribute, in part at least, to this circumstance a peculiarity often
noticed in German emigrants&mdash;namely, that they rapidly become
denationalised and assimilated by the peoples among whom they
settle, and that an Americanised German, for example, has often less
sympathetic feeling for Germany than a foreigner. For, owing
largely to the lack of natural boundaries and the consequent
fluctuations that have occurred, and the mingling and blending with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
other peoples, Germany is a less clear-cut conception than Great
Britain or France; to be a German is something much less definite
than to be an Englishman or a Japanese, or even a Frenchman or
a Spaniard<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. And the presence or lack of definite natural territorial
boundaries operates in a similar way through many centuries, determining
on the one hand historical continuity to a people as a whole,
or on the other hand breaches of historical continuity.</p>

<p>The United States of America afford a fine example of the
binding influence of a well-defined territory; for here the effect is
clearly isolated from racial factors and from slowly accumulated
tradition. The Monroe doctrine is the outward official expression
of this effect. The private individual effect is a sense of part
ownership of a splendid territory with a great future before it.
And we are told, I believe truly, that this sense is very strong
and very generally diffused even among immigrants; that it inspires
an unselfish enthusiasm for the work of developing the immense
resources of the country; that this is the idealistic motive of
much of the intense activity which we are apt to ascribe to
the love of the &#8216;almighty dollar&#8217;; and that it is one of the main
causes of the rapid assimilation of immigrants to the national type
of mind.</p>

<p>The Chinese nation, again, owes its existence and its homogeneity
of mental and physical type to geographical unity. Roughly, China
consists of the basins of two immense rivers, not separated from
one another by any great physical barrier, but forming a compact
territory well marked off save in the north. It comprises no such
partially separate areas as in Europe are constituted by Spain, or
Italy, or Greece, or Scandinavia, or even France; almost all parts
are well adapted for agriculture. Hence, largely, the national unity
and the national sentiment which have long existed, and possibly a
latent capacity for national thought and action.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking instance of all is ancient Egypt. There,
in the long strip of land rendered fertile by the waters of the Nile,
a people of mixed origin was long shut up and isolated; there all
men felt their immediate dependence on the same great powers, the
great river which once a year overflows its banks, and the scorching
sun which passes every day across a cloudless sky. There all men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
looked out on the same unvarying and unvaried landscape,
hoped and feared for the same causes, suffered the same pains,
prayed for the same goods. There was formed one of the most
stable and enduring of nations, whose uniform culture certainly
bears the impress of the uniform monotonous physical environment<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>The other way in which physical environment affects homogeneity
is by determining similarity or difference of occupations and,
through them, similarities or differences of practical interests and
of acquired qualities. So long as such differences are determined
in many small areas, the result is merely a greater differentiation
of the parts, without danger to the unity of the whole nation. But,
when the physical differences divide a whole people into two or
more locally separate groups differing in occupation and interests
and habits, they endanger the unity of the whole. There are to-day
many countries in which the distribution of mineral wealth is
exerting an influence of this sort, giving rise to the differentiation
of an industrial area from agricultural areas and a consequent
divergence of interests and of mental habits; notably South Africa,
Spain, and Italy.</p>

<p>Great Britain is fortunate in this respect also. Its geological
formation presents on a small scale all the principal strata from the
oldest to the most recent, a fact which secures great diversity within
a compact area, an area too compact to allow of divergences of
population being produced by differences of geological formation;
so that it enjoys the advantages of diversity without its drawbacks.
Although a certain degree of differentiation between north and south
may be noted, it is not sharp or great enough to be dangerous. But let
us imagine that coal and iron had been confined to Scotland. Would
there be now the same harmony between the two countries as
actually obtains? The United States of America afford a good
illustration of this principle, as I have already pointed out; the
sub-tropical climate of the southern states gave rise to a differentiation
of occupation, and consequently of ideas and interests and
sentiments, which was almost fatal to the unity of the nation. A
similar differentiation between the agricultural west and the industrial
and commercial east seems to be the greatest danger to the future
unity of the nation; and the same may be said of the Canadian people.</p>

<p>Ireland illustrates well the effects of both kinds of physical
influence. The Irish Channel has perpetuated that difference of race
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and consequent difference of religion, which, but for it, would probably
have been wiped out by free intermarriage; while the lack of coal
and iron in the greater part of the country has prevented the spread
of industrialism, and has thus accentuated the difference between
the Irish people and the English. And it is obvious that among
the Protestants of Ulster the accessibility of coal and iron, maintaining
a divergence of occupations and of interests which prevents
racial and cultural blending, perpetuates the racial and traditional
differences between them and the rest of the population.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4>FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION AS A CONDITION
OF NATIONAL LIFE</h4>

<p>Let us consider now very briefly in relation to the life of a nation
a second essential condition of all collective mental life&mdash;namely,
that the individuals shall be in free communication with one another.
This is obviously necessary to the formation of national mind and
character. It is only through an immense development of the
means of communication, especially the printing press, the railway
and the telegraph, that the modern Nation-State has become possible,
and has become the dominant type of political organism. So familiar
are we with this type, that we are apt to identify the Nation and
the State and to regard the large Nation-State as the normal type
of State and of Nation, forgetting that its evolution was not possible
before the modern period.</p>

<p>In the ancient world the City-State was the dominant type of
political organism; and to Plato and Aristotle any other type seemed
undesirable, if not impossible. For they recognised that collective
deliberation and volition are essential to the true State. Aristotle,
trying to imagine a vast city, remarks&mdash;&#8220;But a city, having such
vast circuit, would contain a nation rather than a state, like
Babylon.&#8221; The translator there uses the word &#8216;nation,&#8217; not in the
modern sense, but rather as we use &#8216;people&#8217; to denote a population
of common stock not organised to form a nation. The limits of the
political organism capable of a collective mental life were rightly
held to be set by the number of citizens who could live so close
together as to meet in one place to discuss all public affairs by word
of mouth.</p>

<p>The great empires of antiquity were not nations; they had no
collective mental life. Although the Roman Empire, in the course
of its long and marvellous history, did succeed in generating in almost
all its subject peoples a certain sentiment of pride in and attachment
to the Empire, it cannot be said to have welded them into one nation;
for, in spite of the splendid system of roads and of posting, communication
between the parts was too difficult and slow to permit
the reciprocal influences essential to collective life. As in all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
ancient empires, the parts were held together only by a centralised
despotic executive organisation; there was no possibility of collective
deliberation and volition<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>All through history there has obviously been some correlation
between the size of political organisms and the degree of development
of means of communication. At the present time those means
have become so highly developed that the widest spaces of land
and sea no longer present any insuperable limits to the size of nations;
and the natural tendency for the growth of the larger states at the
expense of the smaller, by the absorption of the latter, seems to be
increasingly strong. It seems not unlikely that almost the whole
population of the world will shortly be included in five immense
States&mdash;the Russian or Slav, the Central European, the British, the
American, and the Yellow or East Asiatic State. The freedom of
communication between the countries of Europe is now certainly
sufficient to allow of their forming a single nation, if other conditions,
such as diversities of racial type and of historical sentiments, would
permit it.</p>

<p>Although, then, the platform and the orator and the assembly
remain important influences in modern times, it is primarily the
telegraph, wireless telegraphy, the printing press, and the steam
engine, that have rendered possible the large modern nations; for
these have facilitated the dissemination of news and the expression
of feeling and opinion on a large scale, and the free circulation of
persons<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>Without this freedom of communication the various parts of the
nation cannot become adequately conscious of one another; and the
idea of the whole must remain very rudimentary in the minds of
individuals; each part of the whole remains ignorant of many
other parts, and there can be no vivid consciousness of a common
welfare and a common purpose. But, more important still, there
can be none of that massive influence of the whole upon each of
the units which is of the essence of collective mental life. Of these
means of reciprocal influence the press is the most important; though,
of course, its great influence is only rendered possible by the railway
and the telegraph.</p>

<p>Hence we find that it is as regards the press that Great Britain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and America differ most markedly from such states as Germany,
and still more Russia. To an Englishman or American the meagre
news-sheets which in Germany take the place of our daily and weekly
press bring a shock of astonishment when he first discovers them;
and that astonishment is not diminished when he finds that the
best people hardly trouble to look at them occasionally<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how the general election of January, 1910
illustrated the importance of improved means of communication.
It was found that the number of citizens voting at the polls was a
far larger proportion of those on the register than at any previous
election; and, in this respect, the election was a more complete expression
of the will of the people than any preceding one. This seems
to have been due to the use of the motor-car, at that time the latest
great addition to our means of communication.</p>

<p>The modern improvements of means of communication tend
strongly to diminish the importance of the geographical factors we
considered in the foregoing chapter; for they practically abolish
what in earlier ages were physical barriers to intercourse; they render
capital and labour more mobile; and they make many forms of
industry less dependent upon local physical conditions and, therefore,
less strictly confined by geographical factors. As instances
of important developments of this order in the recent past or near
future, the reader may be reminded of the railway over the Andes
between Chile and Argentina, the tunnels through the Alps, the
Channel tunnel, the Siberian railway, the Suez and Panama canals,
the Cape to Cairo railway, and, above all, aerial transport. All these
make for free intercourse between peoples.</p>

<p>Easy means of communication promote development in the
direction of the organic unity of a nation in another way&mdash;namely,
they promote specialisation of the functions of different regions; they
thus render local groups incapable of living as relatively independent
closed communities; for they make each local group more dependent
upon others, each upon all and the whole upon each; hence they
develop the common interest of each part in the good of the whole.</p>

<p>This influence already extends beyond national groups and it
had been hoped that its further growth was about to render war
between nations impossible<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. To-day England is contemplating a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
task never before attempted, the fusing into one nation of the peoples
of the mother-country and her distant colonies. Whether or no she
will succeed depends upon whether the enormously increased facilities
of communication can overcome the principal effects of physical
barriers that we have noted&mdash;namely, lack of intermarriage and
divergence of occupations, with the consequent divergence of mental
type and interests. The task is infinitely more difficult than the
establishment of such an Empire as the Roman; not because the
distances are greater, but because the union must take the form of
nationhood, because it must take the form of a collective mind and
not that of a merely executive organisation. But, in the considerations
which have shown us that membership in and devotion to a
smaller group is by no means adverse to membership in and devotion
to a larger group, we have ground for believing that the task is not
impossible of achievement.</p>

<p>The slow rate of progress towards nationhood of such peoples
as the Russian and the Chinese has been largely due to lack of
means of free communication between the parts of these countries.
On the introduction of improved communications, we may expect
to see rapid progress of this kind; for many of the other essential
conditions are already present in both countries.</p>

<p>The fact that in the Nation-State the communications between
individuals and between the parts of the whole are in the main
indirect, mediated by the press, the telegraph, and the printed word
in general, rather than by voice and gesture and the other direct
bodily expressions of thought and emotion, modifies the primary
manifestations of group life in important ways which we must notice
in a later chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>THE PART OF LEADERS IN NATIONAL LIFE</h4>

<p>We turn now to a third very important condition of the growth
of the national mind, one which also has its analogue in both the
crowd and the army. A crowd always tends to follow some leader
in thought, feeling, and action; and its actions are effective in proportion
as it does so. To follow and obey a leader is the simplest,
most rudimentary fashion in which the crowd&#8217;s action may become
more effective, consistent, intelligent, controlled. Not any one can be
such a leader; exceptional qualities are necessary. In every army
the importance of leadership is fully recognised. A hierarchy of
leaders is the essence of its organisation. In the deliberately organised
army, the appointment of leaders is the principal and almost the
sole direct means taken by the State to organise the army. Everything
is done to give to the leaders of each grade the greatest possible
prestige, especially by multiplying and accentuating the distinctions
between the grades. Though much can be accomplished in this way,
unless the men chosen as leaders have in some degree the superior
qualities required by their position in the hierarchy, the whole
organisation will be of little value.</p>

<p>The same is true in much higher degree of nations. If a people
is to become a nation, it must be capable of producing personalities
of exceptional powers, who will play the part of leaders; and the
special endowments of the national leader require to be more pronounced
and exceptional, of a higher order, than those required
for the exercise of leadership over a fortuitous crowd.</p>

<p>Such personalities, more effectively perhaps than any other factors,
engender national unity and bring it to a high pitch. There are
regions in which the other main conditions of national unity have
long obtained, but which have failed to become the seat of any
enduring nation. Although the greater part of Africa, perhaps the
richest continent of the globe, has been in the possession of the
negro races during all the ages in which the European, Asiatic, and
American civilisations were being developed, those races have
never founded a nation. Nevertheless many, perhaps most, negroes
are capable of acquiring European culture and of turning it to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
good account. And, when brought under the influence of Arabs or
men of other races, they have formed rudimentary nations<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. The
incapacity to form a nation must be connected with the fact that the
race has never produced any individuals of really high mental and
moral endowments, even when brought under foreign influences; and
it would seem that it is incapable of producing such individuals; the
few distinguished negroes, so called, of America&mdash;such as Douglas,
Booker Washington, Du Bois&mdash;have been, I believe, in all cases
mulattoes or had some proportion of white blood. We may fairly
ascribe the incapacity of the negro race to form a nation to the lack
of men endowed with the qualities of great leaders, even more than
to the lower level of average capacity. On the other hand, there is
at least one people which, in the absence of every other condition,
has continued to retain something of the character of a nation for
many generations&mdash;namely, the Jews. The Jews are not even racially
homogeneous, and they are scattered through all the world under
the most varied physical conditions; yet the influence of a succession
of men of exceptional power, Moses and his successors the prophets,
all devoted to the same end&mdash;namely, the establishment of the Jewish
nation and religion&mdash;has lived on through many generations and
still holds this people together, marking it off from all others.</p>

<p>This is an extreme instance. But another almost equally striking
case is that of the Arab nation, which has owed its existence to one
man. The Arab nation was made by the genius of Mahomet, who
welded together, by the force of his personality and the originality
and intensity of his religious conviction, the warring idolatrous clans
of Arabia. Until his advent these had been a scattered multitude,
in spite of racial and geographical uniformity, geographical isolation,
and fairly free intercommunication. We have here one of the purest,
clearest instances of the effect of great personalities in furthering
nationhood; for there seems to be no reason to believe that, if
Mahomet had not lived, any such development of the Arabian people
would have taken place.</p>

<p>M. le Bon has produced a curious piece of evidence bearing on
this question. He has measured the cranial capacity of a great
number of skulls of different races, and has shown that any large
collection of skulls from one of the peoples who have formed a
progressive nation invariably contains a certain small number of skulls
of markedly superior capacity, implying exceptionally large brains;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
while any similar collection of skulls from one of the unprogressive
peoples, like the negro, differs, not so much in the smaller average
size of the brain, as in the greater uniformity of size, that is to say,
the absence of individuals of exceptionally large brains<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. He, rightly,
I think, sees in the absence of such individuals a main condition of
the unprogressive character of these races; and, in the exceptionally
large brains produced among the other peoples, a main condition of
their progress.</p>

<p>These indications are borne out by a review of the history of
any nation that has achieved a considerable development. Every
such people has its national heroes whom it rightly glorifies or
worships; for to them it owes in chief part its existence.</p>

<p>To them also it owes in large measure the forms of its institutions,
its religion, its dominant ideas and ideals, its morals, its art and
literature, all that of which it is most proud, all its victories of peace
as well as of war, the memory of which and the common pride in
which is the strongest of all national bonds<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p>Who can estimate the enormous influence of Confucius and Laotse
in moulding and rendering uniform the culture of China? The
influence of single individuals has undoubtedly been greater in the
early than in the later stages of civilisation; for there was then a
more open field, a virgin soil, as it were, for the reception of their
influence. In the developed nation the mass of accumulated knowledge
and tradition is so much greater, that the modifications and
additions made by any one man necessarily are relatively small.</p>

<p>The leading modern nations owe their position to their having
produced great men in considerable numbers; for that reason also
no one man stands out so prominently as Mahomet or Confucius or
Moses. Nevertheless their existence can in many cases be traced to
some few great men. Would Germany now be a nation, but for
Frederick the Great and Bismarck? Would America, but for
Washington, Hamilton, and Lincoln? Would Italy, but for Garibaldi
and Mazzini and Cavour? How greatly is the unity of national spirit
and tradition among Englishmen due to the great writers who have
produced the national literature, and to the great statesmen and
soldiers and sailors who have given her a proud position in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
world! What would England be now if Shakespeare, Newton and
Darwin, Cromwell and Chatham, Marlborough and Nelson and
Wellington had never been born?</p>

<p>And it is not only the men of great genius who are essential to
the modern nation, but also men of more than average powers,
though not of the very highest.</p>

<p>Let us try to imagine the fifty leading minds in each great
department of activity suddenly removed from among us. That will
help us to realise the extent to which the mental life of the nation
is dependent on them. Clearly, we should be reduced to intellectual,
moral, and aesthetic chaos and nullity in a very short time. If a
similar state of affairs should continue for some few generations,
Britain would very soon cease to be of any importance in the world.
The force of national traditions might keep up a certain unity; but
we should be a people, or a crowd, living in the past, without energy,
without pride in the present or hope in the future, having perhaps
a little melancholy national sentiment, but incapable of national
thought or action.</p>

<p>The continuance of the power and prosperity and unity of
national life, the continued existence of the national mind and
character, depends, then, upon the continued production of numbers
of such men of more than average capacity. It is these men
who keep alive from generation to generation, and spread among the
masses and so render effective, the ideas and the moral influence of
the men of supremely great powers. These men exert a guidance
and a selection over the cultural elements which the mass of men
absorb. They praise what they believe to be good, and decry what
they believe to be bad; and, in virtue of the prestige which their
exceptional powers have brought them, their verdict is accepted and
moulds popular opinion and sentiment.</p>

<p>Consider how great in this way has been the influence of men like
Carlyle, Matthew Arnold, and Ruskin. The tone and standard of
taste, thought, and sentiment are set and maintained by such men. It
is in their minds chiefly that the system of ideals and sentiments,
which are the guiding principles and moving forces of the national
mind, is perpetuated. They are truly &#8216;the salt of the earth&#8217;; without
them the nation would soon fall into fragments, or become an inert
and powerless mass of but low degree of organisation and unity.</p>

<p>It is because the national ideals and sentiments are formed by
these leading spirits, and are perpetuated and developed by them,
and by them impressed in some degree upon the mass of the people,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and because in all national movements their influence predominates,
that the judgments and actions, the character and the sentiments, of
a nation may be different from, and in the higher nations are superior
to those of the average men of the nation. As Fouill&eacute;e said&mdash;&#8220;The
national character is not always best expressed by the mass,
by the vulgar, nor even by the actual majority. There exists a
natural <i>&eacute;lite</i> which, better than all the rest, represents the soul of
the entire people, its radical ideas and its most essential tendencies.
This is what the politicians too often forget<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.&#8221; That is to say, it is
what they forget when, as is too often the case in this country, they
consider that no movement must be undertaken till the mass of the
people demands it. They ignore the fact that leadership is essential
to the maintenance of national life at a high level, and, instead of
exercising initiative, they wait for it to come from below&mdash;wait for
a mandate, as they say. The late President Rooseveldt was a fine
example of the contrary type of statesmanship. The character of
the talents displayed by these exceptionally gifted individuals determines
largely the form of the civilisation and, through shaping the
social environment, tends to bring the minds of the mass of individuals
more or less into harmony with it, giving them something
of the same tendencies.</p>

<p>The men of genius of certain peoples, more especially peoples of
relative racial purity, have excelled in some one direction. Thus
the Semites have produced great religious teachers and little else,
and have given to the world its three great monotheistic religions.
The Tartar race has produced from time to time great soldiers and
little else. It has made immense conquests and established dynasties
ruling over other peoples. But, as in the case of the Turks, who owe
their national existence to a line of great despots of the house of
Othman, they make little progress in civilisation and they do not
unify the peoples they rule; for they produce ability of no other
kind.</p>

<p>We see in most of the leading European nations the predominance
of certain forms of genius. Modern Italy boasts chiefly men great
in religion and art, perhaps owing to the predominance of <i>Homo
Mediterraneus</i>; Spain in pictorial art and military conquest;
England in poetry and administration and science; Germany in
music and philosophy. Nevertheless, each of these peoples has produced
men of the greatest power in all or several kinds; and this we
may connect with the fact that they are all of very mixed racial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
composition. And we may add that France, the most composite or
mixed racially, has produced the greatest variety of genius.</p>

<p>The production of the largest numbers of eminent men by peoples
of mixed and blended racial elements, not too widely different, is
what biological knowledge would lead us to expect. For, if a subrace
is produced by crossing of varieties, it will be one of much greater
variability than a pure race; as we see in the cases of the domesticated
horse and dog and pigeon, of which the modern varieties are only
kept pure by continual rejection of the departures from the standards,
and of which the great variability renders possible the production,
by selection of very marked new features in a brief period of time.</p>

<p>The many elements which go to form the mental constitution of
an individual become, in a mixed race, variously combined. If the
crossed races are very widely different, the results seem to be in
nearly all cases bad. The character of the cross-bred is made up of
divergent inharmonious tendencies, which give rise to internal conflict,
just as the physical features appear in bizarre combination; what
examples we have&mdash;the Spanish Americans, the Eurasians, the
Mulattoes, the half-breeds of Java and Canada&mdash;seem to show that
a people so composed will produce few great men and will not become
a great nation.</p>

<p>But, when the crossed races are less widely divergent, the
elements of which the mental constitution is composed (and which
direct observation and analogy with physical heredity show to be
transmitted more or less independently of one another from parent
to offspring) have opportunities to come together in new combinations,
which result in mental constitutions unlike those of either parent
(that is to say, the cross-breds are variable); and among these new
combinations, while some will form minds below the average,
others will form minds above the average in various degrees; and
these, so long as the constitution is not too much weakened
by radical lack of harmony of its elements, will be the effective
great men.</p>

<p>Incidentally, these considerations perhaps throw light on a fact
much discussed&mdash;namely, that exceptional powers, especially when
of highly specialised nature, are often exhibited by persons of unstable
mental constitution; whence arises the popular belief that
genius is allied to, or is a form of, insanity.</p>

<p>These considerations also raise a presumption that peoples
derived by the blending of several stocks may be expected to have
progressed further in civilisation and in national growth than those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of purer stock; and that, while the racial purity of a people may give
stability, such a people will be liable to arrest and crystallisation
of civilisation at an early stage, before culture is sufficiently advanced
to render possible a highly developed national life. These indications
are well borne out by a survey of the peoples of the world. We may
see here, in all probability, one of the main causes of the early
crystallisation of Chinese civilisation. Homogeneity and racial purity
have produced extreme stability, but at the cost of the variability
which produces great and original minds, and, therefore, at the cost
of capacity for national progress beyond an early stage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4>OTHER CONDITIONS OF NATIONAL LIFE</h4>

<p>In the two foregoing chapters, we have considered in relation to
the life of nations three principal conditions essential to all collective
mental life and action, even that of the unorganised crowd&mdash;namely,
homogeneity, free communications and leadership. We have now
to consider other conditions which may render the collective mental
processes of nations very different from, and superior to, those of
a mere crowd.</p>

<p>In considering a patriot army as exemplifying collective life of
a relatively high level, we distinguished five principal conditions that
raise it above the level of the mental life of the crowd, in addition
to one which is present in some crowds. This last was a common
well-defined purpose present to, and dominant in, the minds of all
individuals. It is this condition mainly that renders the collective
mental life of such an army so simple, so relatively easy to understand,
and so extremely effective.</p>

<p>This condition&mdash;a clearly defined common purpose dominant in
the minds of the great mass of the constituent units&mdash;is for the
most part lacking in the life of nations; its absence is one of the
principal reasons for the ineffectiveness and bewildering complexity
of their mental life. It is, however, occasionally realised in national
life, and then we see how immense is its influence. Such an occasion
is a war for national existence. Consider how, when the excesses of
the French Revolution excited all the monarchies of Europe to attack
France, the French nation, becoming animated with the one strong
purpose of asserting its right to exist and to choose its own form of
government, successfully drove back all its enemies and rose to a
height of power and glory greater than at any other period; and how,
at the same time, its parts were welded more firmly together, so that
it displayed a high degree of unity as well as of efficiency. Having
achieved this high degree of unity and efficiency, the French nation,
led on by the ambitions of Napoleon, became aggressive. And we are
told by the historians that the attacks of Napoleon upon the various
European peoples, which threatened to destroy whatever degree of
national life those peoples had attained, were like the blows of a
smith&#8217;s hammer and resulted in welding together and hardening into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
nations the loosely aggregated races ruled over by the various
monarchs; and that in this way these attacks initiated the modern
period of Nation-States<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p>War for national existence unifies nations. So long as the nation
is not utterly shattered and crushed, such war greatly develops the
national mind; because it makes one common purpose dominate the
minds of all the citizens.</p>

<p>We are told that it is a practical maxim of cynical rulers to
plunge their people into war when they are faced by dangerous
internal discontents; and the reason usually given is that war
diverts the attention of the people from their domestic grievances.
But if it is a national war, a war in which the national existence is
at stake, it does far more than merely divert attention; it binds the
nation into a harmonious efficient whole by creating a common
purpose; whereas, if the war is not of this order and is waged in some
distant country and merely for some territorial aggrandisement, it has
little or no such effect. Thus the recent Russo-Japanese war did little
or nothing at the time to raise the Russian people in the scale of nationhood;
it was followed by a period of national weakness; the national
existence was not endangered, the objects of the war were too remote
from the interests of the mass of the people to appeal to them strongly.
Whereas the same war and the years of preparation for it, following
upon the previous Chino-Japanese war, have made the Japanese one
of the most efficient and harmonious nations of the world.</p>

<p>Another striking example of the same principle was the formation
of modern Bulgaria as a strong Nation-State out of a population of
quiet peasant proprietors united only by spatial proximity and by their
racial distinctness from the surrounding populations. This creation
of a strong nation out of a mere population of peasants was in the
main the work of the war of 1885, by which the unprovoked attack
of Servia was triumphantly repelled<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p>The unity and nationhood of modern Germany is largely due to
similar causes; and the war of 1871 may fairly be said to have led
to a further integration of the national life of the French people, in
spite of their defeat. America owes something of the same kind to the
Spanish war; and the entry of that nation into the Great War, long
delayed as it was, will probably be found to have had a similar
effect. The French and Italian nations have undoubtedly been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
welded more firmly by the Great War; while England and her
sister and daughter nations (with the one sad exception of the Irish)
have been united, by their co-operation in the one great purpose, to
a degree which no other conceivable event could have achieved and
which many generations of peaceful industry and enlightened political
efforts might have failed to approach.</p>

<p>History offers no parallel to these effects of war; and it is difficult
or impossible to imagine any other common purpose which could
exert this binding influence in a similar degree. But it is worth while
to notice that other and minor forms of international rivalry have
corresponding effects. The international rivalry in aeronautics affords
a contemporary illustration. Perhaps every one in this country has
felt some degree of interest and satisfaction in the achievements of
the adventurous spirits of our nation who have traversed the Atlantic
by air. And it is probably largely owing to the prevalence of this
national pride and purpose that, at a time demanding strict national
economy, no voice has been raised against the enormous current
expenditure of the government upon aeronautics.</p>

<p>Another and more important effect of the same kind is produced
by the assumption of great national responsibilities in the way of
administration in respect of backward peoples and undeveloped
territories. The greatest example in history is the responsibility of
Great Britain for the administration of India, gradually and only
half-consciously assumed, but now keenly felt as at once a legitimate
ground of national pride and a moral responsibility that cannot be
laid aside. It is like the responsibility of the father of a family
in its semi-instinctive origin and in its effects in steadying and
strengthening character, for it imposes a responsibility which the
nation, like the individual, cannot discharge indifferently without
seriously damaging its reputation and prestige in the eyes of the
world. Holland owes some of the strength of her nationhood to
such influences; and the assumption by the American nation of
responsibility for the peoples of Cuba and of the Phillipine islands
cannot fail to bring them in some degree similar moral benefits<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the five other conditions of the higher development of a
collective mind, let us notice, first and very briefly, continuity of
existence, material and formal. Of course every nation has this in
some degree, but some have it in much higher degree than others.
The English nation is fortunate in this respect also. It has preserved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
both its formal and its material continuity in very high degree
throughout many centuries, in fact ever since the Norman Conquest.
No European nation can compare with it in this respect; it is only
surpassed by China and perhaps Japan. The French nation has
preserved its material continuity, its population and territory, in
high degree. But the Great Revolution cut across and destroyed to
a great extent its formal continuity, so that, as is sometimes said,
the French nation has cut itself off from its past and made a new
start; although, in doing so, it did not get rid of its highly centralised
system of administration. The modern Italian and German nations
are quite recent growths, their formal continuity having been subject
to many interruptions. Spain, with her almost insular position,
might have had continuity; but it was greatly disturbed by the
imperial ambitions of her rulers in the sixteenth century and by
the expulsion of the Moors. Greece is a striking example of loss of
both material and formal continuity. The population of ancient
Greece, which put her in the van of civilisation, has been largely
abolished and supplanted by a different race; and her formal continuity
also has suffered a number of complete ruptures.</p>

<p>Now material and formal continuity is, as we said, the essential
presupposition of all the other main conditions of development
of the collective mind. On it depends the strength of custom and
tradition and, to a very great extent, the strength of national
sentiment. It is, therefore, a principal condition of national stability;
from it arise all the great conservative tendencies of the nation,
all the forces that resist change; accordingly, the more complete
and long enduring such continuity has been in the past, the greater is
the prospect of its prolongation in the future. It is owing to the
unbroken continuity of the English nation through so long a period
that its organisation is so stable, its unwritten constitution so effective,
at once stable and plastic, its national sentiment so strong,
its complex uncoded system of judge-made law so nearly in harmony
with popular feeling and therefore so respected. National organisation
resting upon this basis of custom and traditional sentiment is
the only kind that is really stable, that is not liable to be suddenly
overthrown by internal upheavals or impacts from without. For it
alone is rooted in the minds of all citizens in the forms of habit and
sentiment. All other organisation is imposed by authority.</p>

<p>In this respect modern England and Germany offer a striking
contrast that forces itself upon the most casual observation. As
regards the mass of the people, the position of each individual in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the organism of the German nation is officially determined by the
written and codified law of the State; all personal status and relations
are formally determined by official positions in this recently created
system. Almost every individual carries about some badge or
uniform indicating his position within the system. In England, the
status and relations of individuals are determined by factors a
thousand times more subtle and complex, involving many vaguely
conceived and undefined traditions and sentiments. In Germany,
it is almost true to say, if a man has no official position he has no
position at all. In England, the comparatively few persons who have
official positions have also their social positions by which their
private relations are determined. They are officials only in their
offices; whereas the German official is an official everywhere.</p>

<p>Other important topics we have to consider are (1) the organisation
of the national mind; (2) the national self-consciousness;
(3) the interaction of the nation as a whole with other nations. All
these we may advantageously consider in the light of an analogy,
the analogy between the individual mind and the collective mind of
the nation. This is a much closer and more illuminating analogy
than that between the nation, or society, and the material organism.
The latter analogy has been developed in detail by H. Spencer,
Sch&auml;ffle<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and others; it has now fallen into some disrepute. It
has no doubt a certain value, but it is popularly used in a way that
leads to quite unjustifiable conclusions. Of these fallacies by far
the most commonly accepted is that which asserts that, just as every
animal organism inevitably grows old and dies, so too must nations.</p>

<p>This is one of the most popular dogmas of amateur philosophers,
and so distinguished a statesman as the late Lord Salisbury gave it
countenance; while Mr A. J. Balfour in his recent Sidgwick Memorial
Lecture<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> courageously breaks away and proposes to substitute for
senility as the cause of decay the word <i>decadence</i>&mdash;a proposal which
merely implies that he trusts less to the analogical argument from
the material organism and more to empirical induction, to the
observation of the fact that so many nations have decayed.</p>

<p>All this serves to illustrate the dangers of analogy. We need no
special cause to account for the fall and the decay of nations, no
obscure principle of senility or decadence; the wonderful thing is
that they exist at all; and what needs explanation is not so much
the decay of some, but rather the long persistence of others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us turn, then, to the analogy between the organisation of
the national collective mind and that of the individual mind, which,
I say, is so much closer and more illuminating than that between
a society and a bodily organisation.</p>

<p>The actions of the individual organism are the expression of its
mental constitution or organisation; in some creatures this organisation
is almost wholly innate&mdash;the organisation consists of a number
of reflex and instinctive dispositions each specialised for bringing
about a special kind of behaviour under certain circumstances.
Such old established racial dispositions with their special tendencies
have their place in more complexly developed minds; but in these
their operations are complicated and modified by the life of ideas,
and by a variety of habits developed under the guidance of ideas and
in the light of individual experience.</p>

<p>The enduring reflex and instinctive dispositions of the individual
mind we may liken to the established institutions of a nation, such
as the army and navy, the post office, the judicial and the administrative
systems of officials. These, like the instincts, are specialised
executive organisations working in relative independence of one
another, each discharging some specialised function adapted to
satisfy some constantly recurring need of the whole organism. In
both cases such semi-independent organisations, the instincts or the
institutions, are relatively fixed and stable, and they work, if left to
themselves, quasi-mechanically along old established lines, without
intelligent adaptation to new circumstances; and they are incapable
of self-adaptation. In both cases, the mental organisation is in
part materialised, the instinct in the form of specialised nervous
structure, the institution in the form of the material organisation
essential to its efficient action, the buildings, the printed codes, the
whole material apparatus of complex national administration. In
both cases, the actions in which they play their part are not purely
mechanical but to some extent truly psychical&mdash;though of a low
order.</p>

<p>If we accept the view, which is held by many, that instincts and
reflexes are the semi-mechanised results of successive mental adaptations
effected by the mental efforts of successive generations, then
the analogy is still closer; for the permanent national institutions
are also the accumulated semi-mechanised products of the efforts
at adaptation of many generations.</p>

<p>The organisation of some nations resembles that of the minds
of those animals whose behaviour is purely instinctive. Such is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
nation whose organisation takes the form of a rigid caste system.
Each caste performs its special functions in the prescribed manner
in relative independence of all the others. And, in both cases, the
organisation of the mind includes no means of bringing the different
fixed tendencies or dispositions into harmonious co-operation in the
face of unusual circumstances. The whole system lacks plasticity
and adaptability; for it is relatively mechanical and of a low degree
of integration. Any true adaptation of the whole organism by mental
effort is impossible in both cases.</p>

<p>The higher type of individual mind is characterised by the
development of the intellectual organisation by means of which the
activities of the various instincts, the executive organisations, may
be brought into co-operation with, or duly subordinated to, one
another; and the activities of each such individual may be further
adapted to meet novel combinations of circumstances not provided
for in the innate organisation; hence, the activities of the whole
organism, instead of being a succession of quasi-mechanical actions,
and of crude conflicts between the impulses or tendencies of the
different instincts, reveal a higher degree of harmony of the parts, a
greater integration of the whole system, and a much greater adaptability
to novel circumstances; while, at the same time, the behaviour
of the whole, in face of any one of the situations provided for by
innate organisation or instinct, is liable to be less sure and perfect
than in the case of the less complex, less highly evolved type of mind.</p>

<p>Exactly the same is true of the more highly evolved type of
national mind. Like the lower type, it has its executive institutions
and hierarchies of officials, organised for the carrying out of specialised
tasks subserving the economy of the whole. But, in addition, it has
a deliberative organisation which renders possible a play of ideas;
and, through this, the operations of the institutions are modified and
controlled in detail and are harmonised in a way which constitutes
a higher integration of the whole.</p>

<p>In both cases ideas and judgments reached by the deliberative
processes can only become effective in the world of things and conduct
by setting to work, or calling into play, one or more of the executive
dispositions or institutions.</p>

<p>In both cases, ideas and the deliberative processes, which to some
extent control the operations of the innate or traditional dispositions,
produce, in so doing, some permanent modification of them in
the direction of adaptation to deal with novel circumstances; so
that the dispositions or institutions grow and change under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
guidance of the deliberative processes, slowly becoming better
adapted for the expression of the ruling ideas; they become better
instruments, and more completely at the service of ideas and of
the will.</p>

<p>Just as the animal, on the instinctive plane of mental life, displays
a very efficient activity in the special situation which brings some one
instinct into play, so any one caste of a caste-nation may perform
its function under normal circumstances with great efficiency, the
priestly caste its priestly function, the warrior caste, or the caste of
sweepers, its function; and, in both cases, the development of the
deliberative organisation is apt to interfere to some extent with the
perfect execution of these specialised functions.</p>

<p>Again, in the individual mind, adaptation of conduct to novel
circumstances, or to secure improved action in familiar circumstances,
requires the direction of the attention, that is the concentration
of the whole energy of the mind, upon the task; whereas, when the
new mode of behaviour is often repeated, it becomes more and more
automatic; for, owing to the formation of new nervous organisation,
the attention is set free for other tasks of adaptation. Just in the
same way new modes of national behaviour are only effected when
the attention of the nation&#8217;s mind is turned upon the situation;
whereas, with recurrence of the need for any such novel mode of
action, there is formed some special executive organisation, say
a Colonial Office, or an Unemployed Central Committee, or an
Imperial Conference, which deals with it in a more or less routine
fashion, and which, as it becomes perfected, needs less and less
to be controlled and guided by national attention and therefore
operates in the margin of the field of consciousness of the national
mind, while public attention is set free to turn itself to other tasks
of national adaptation.</p>

<p>We may also regard the customs of a nation as analogous with
the habits of the individual, if (for the sake of the analogy) we accept
the view that instincts are habits that have become hereditary; for
custom is an informal mode in which routine behaviour is determined,
and it tends to lead on to, and to become embodied in, formal
institutions; it is like habit, a transition stage between new adaptation
and perfected organisation. Individual adaptation, habit and
instinct are parallel to national adaptation, custom and legal institution.</p>

<p>At the risk of wearying the reader, I will refer to one last point
of the analogy. Individual minds become more completely integrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
in proportion as they achieve a full self-consciousness, in
proportion as the idea of the self becomes rich in content and the
nucleus of a strong sentiment generating impulses that control and
override impulses of all other sources. In a similar way, the national
mind becomes more completely integrated in proportion as it
achieves full self-consciousness, that is, in proportion as the idea
of the nation becomes widely diffused among the individual minds,
becomes rich in content and the nucleus of a strong sentiment
that supplies motives capable of overriding and controlling all other
motives.</p>

<p>Consider now in the light of this analogy the principal types of
national organisation. The organisation of some peoples is wholly
the product of the conflicts of blind impulses and purely individual
volitions working through long ages. This is true of many peoples
that have not arrived at a national self-consciousness or, as the French
say, a social consciousness, and are not held in servitude by a despotic
power. It is a natural stage of evolution which corresponds to the
stage of the higher mammals in the scale of evolution of the individual
mind. A nation of this sort has no capacity for collective deliberation
and volitional action. What collective mental life it has is on the
plane of impulse and unregulated desire. Such ideas as are widely
accepted may determine collective action; but such action is not
the result of the weighing of ideas in the light of self-consciousness;
hence they are little adapted to promote the welfare of the nation,
and, because there is no organisation adapted for their expression,
they can be but imperfectly realised.</p>

<p>We may perhaps take China (as she was until recently) as the
highest type of a nation of this sort. Hers was a complex and vast
organisation consisting of very ancient institutions and customs,
slowly evolved by the conflict of impulses and in part imposed by
despotic power and individual wills; not formed by a national will
under the guidance of national self-consciousness<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. Hence China
was incapable of vigorous national thought or volition, and its
nearest approach to collective action was expressed in such blind
impulsive actions as the Taeping Rebellion or the Boxer Rising.
This last seems to have been prompted by a dawning national self-consciousness
which had not, however, so moulded the national
organisation as to make it an efficient instrument of its will.</p>

<p>Of other nations the organisation is, in part only, a natural growth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
having been, in large part, impressed upon it by an external power.
Such is the case in all those many instances in which a foreign power
of higher social organisation has conquered and successfully governed
for a long period a people of lower civilisation. We may see a parallel
to this type in the mind of an individual whose behaviour is in the
main the expression of a number of habits engendered by a severe
discipline which has continued from his earliest years, and which
has never permitted the free development of his natural tendencies
and character. Such was England under the feudal system imposed
upon her by her Norman conquerors. Such also France under
Louis XIV. Such was Russia when the Varegs, the conquering
Northmen, imposed on the almost unorganised mass of Slavs their
rule and a national organisation; and such it remained up to the
outbreak of the Great War, a mass of men in whom the national
consciousness was only just beginning to glimmer here and there,
crudely organised by the bureaucratic power of a few. Even in the
minds of these few the national consciousness and purpose was but
little developed. Individual purposes and individual self-consciousness
predominated. Hence Russia had no capacity for national thought
and action; and when, as recently, ideas stirred the masses to action,
their actions were those of unorganised crowds, impulsive and ineffective;
the ends were but vaguely conceived, the means were not
deliberately chosen, or, if so chosen, found no executive organisation
for the effective expression of the collective purpose.</p>

<p>In such nations the organisation, which has been in the main
created by a small governing class, is adapted only for the execution
of its purposes, and not at all for the formation of a national mind
and the expression of the collective will. The organisation consists
primarily in a system for the collecting of taxes and the compulsory
service of a large army. The revenue is raised for two primary
purposes&mdash;the support of the governing class or caste in luxury and
the support of the army; and the end for which the army is maintained
is primarily the gathering of the taxes, and the further
extension of the tax-collecting system over larger areas and populations&mdash;a
vicious circle. On the other hand, the conditions which
tend to the formation of national mind and character (which would
have quite other ends than these) are naturally suppressed as completely
as possible by the governing few.</p>

<p>Russian history in modern times exemplifies these principles in
the clearest and most complete manner. The effects of this sort of
organisation were very clearly illustrated by Count Tolstoi&#8217;s articles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, in which he expressed as his social creed
and ideal a complete anarchy to be achieved by passive resistance;
denied that nations have or can have any existence; and asserted
that the idea of a nation is as fictitious as it is pernicious. He had
in mind only this type of organisation of a people, which hardly
entitles it to be called a nation. And the same considerations explain
the wide prevalence of philosophic anarchy in Russia.</p>

<p>Another type of national organisation results when the natural
evolution of the national mind and character has been artificially
and unhealthily forced by the pressure of the external environment
of a people, when the need of national self-preservation and self-assertion
compels the mass of the people to submit to an organisation
which is neither the product of a natural evolution through the
conflict of individual wills, nor the expression of the general mind
and will, nor is altogether imposed upon it for the individual purposes
of the few, but is a system planned by the few for the good of the
whole, and by them imposed upon the whole. This is the kind of
organisation of which a modern army stands as the extreme type
and which is best represented among modern nations by Germany
as she was before the War.</p>

<p>Under such a system there appears inevitably a tendency
rigorously to subordinate the welfare of individuals to that of the
nation as a whole. And that was just the state of affairs in Germany.
German political philosophy showed the opposite extreme from
Tolstoi&#8217;s; the individual existed for the nation only. Hence we find
this condition of affairs justified by such writers as Bl&uuml;ntschli<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>,
Treitschke and Bernhardi, who represent the State as having an
existence and a system of rights superior to that of all individuals;
and we see attempts to justify the subordination of individual
interests by means of the doctrine of the &#8216;collective consciousness<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.&#8217;</p>

<p>In such States as that of the foregoing type the one kind of
organisation is alone highly developed, namely the executive organisation;
while the deliberative organisation is very imperfect and is
repressed and discouraged by the governing power. Such a State is
likely to appear very strong in all its relations with other States,
and its material organisation may be developed in an effective and
rapid way, as we have seen in pre-war Germany. But its actions
are not the expression of the national will and are not the outcome
of the general mind. They are designed by the minds of the few for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the good not of all, but of the whole, the good, that is, not of individuals
but of the State.</p>

<p>Organisation of this type is not of high stability, in spite of its
appearance of strength and its efficiency for certain limited purposes,
such as industrial organisation and the promotion and diffusion of
material well-being. In a State so organised there inevitably grows
up an antagonism between individual rights and interests and the
rights and interests of the State. It is psychologically unsound. This
fact was revealed in Germany by the tremendous growth of social
democracy, which was the protest against the subordination of
individual welfare to that of the State. The defect of such organisation
was illustrated by the fact that Germany, though its well-governed
population increased rapidly, for many years continued
to lose great numbers of its population to other countries. For
the mass of the people felt itself to be not so much of the State as
under it. And it is, I think, obvious that the advent of a bad and
stupid monarch might easily have brought on a revolution at any
time.</p>

<p>The inherent weakness of the system induced the governing power
to all sorts of extreme measures directed to maintain its equilibrium
and cohesion. Among such State actions the gravest were perhaps
the deliberate falsification of history by the servile historians and
the suppression and distortion of news by the press at the command
and desire of the State. The expropriation of the Polish landowners
and the treatment of Alsace-Lorraine were other striking manifestations
of the imperfect development of the national mind and of the
corresponding practice and philosophy of the State-craft which the
world has learnt to describe as Prussian.</p>

<p>The organisation of pre-war Germany was, then, very similar
to that of an army and was efficient in a similar way, that is to say
for the attainment of particular immediate ends. In a wider view,
such national organisation is of a lower nature than that of England
or France or America; for the ends or purposes of a nation are
remote, they transcend the vision of the present and cannot be
defined in terms of material prosperity or military power; and only
the development of the national mind, as a natural and spontaneous
growth, can give a prospect of continued progress towards those
indefinable ends. Germany was organised from above for the attainment
of a particular end, namely material prosperity and power
among the peoples of the world; and, as the bulk of her population
had been led to accept this narrow national purpose, the organisation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the nation, like that of an army, was extremely effective for the
purpose. It gave her a great advantage as against the other
nations, among whom the lack of any such clear cut purpose in the
minds of all was a principal difficulty in the way of effective national
thought and action. For a like reason the existence of a nation
organised in this way is a constant threat to the nations of higher
type; and, as we have seen, it may compel them at any time to revert
to or adopt, temporarily at least and so far as they are able, an
organisation of the lower and more immediately effective kind. And
this threat was the justification of the nations of the Entente, when
they demanded a radical change in this political organisation of
Germany. In a similar way, in the past, the Huns, the Turks, and the
Arabs, peoples organised primarily for war and conquest, had to be
destroyed as nations if the evolution of nations of higher type was
to go forward.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h4>THE WILL OF THE NATION<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></h4>

<p>Rousseau, in his famous treatise, <i>Le Contrat Social</i>, wrote &#8220;There is
often a great difference between the will of all and the general will;
the latter looks only to the common interest; the former looks to
private interest, and is nothing but a sum of individual wills; but
take away from these same wills the plus and minus that cancel
one another and there remains, as the sum of the differences, the
general will.&#8221; &#8220;Sovereignty is only the exercise of the general will.&#8221;
That is to say, a certain number of men will the general good, while
most men will only their private good; the latter neutralise one
another, while the former co-operate to form an effective force.</p>

<p>Dr Bosanquet<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, criticising Rousseau&#8217;s doctrine, says that the
general will is expressed by the working of the institutions of the
community which embody its dominant ideas; that no one man
really grasps the nature and relations of the whole society and its
tendencies; that the general will is thus unconscious (by which he
seems to mean that the nation is unconscious of itself and of its
ends or purposes); and he goes on to say that the general will is the
product of practical activities making for nearer smaller ends, and
that its harmony depends on the fact that the activities of each
individual are parts of a systematic whole.</p>

<p>Bosanquet&#8217;s theory amounts to a justification of the old individualist
<i>laissez faire</i> doctrine&mdash;the doctrine that the good of the
whole is best achieved by giving freest possible scope to the play
and conflict of individual purposes and strivings&mdash;the philosophic
radicalism of Bentham and Mill, which teaches that, if each man
honestly and efficiently pursues his private ends, the welfare of the
State somehow results. How this systematic whole which is the
State arises he does not explain; and it seems to me that Bosanquet
leaves unsolved that difficulty which, as we saw, led Schiller and
others to postulate an external power guiding each people&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
difficulty, if we assume that individual wills strive only after private
egoistic ends, of explaining how the good of the whole is nevertheless
achieved.</p>

<p>In all societies many general changes result, and in some nations
no doubt the good of the whole is achieved in a measure by
fortunate accident, in the way Bosanquet describes&mdash;namely, by the
interplay of individual wills working for near individual ends. But,
I think, it is improper to say that in such a case any general will
exists. Such a nation, if it displays any collective activity, only does
so in an impulsive blind way which is not true volition, but is
comparable rather with instinctive action; for, as we have seen, self-consciousness
is essential to volition; a truly volitional action is one
which issues from the contemplation of some end represented in
relation to the idea of the self and found to be desirable. And the
changes of a society which result in the way Bosanquet claims as
the expression of the general will are unforeseen and unwilled;
they are no more the expression and effects of a general will than
are the movements of a billiard ball struck simultaneously by two
or more men each of whom aims at a different position.</p>

<p>Bosanquet maintains that the national will is unconscious of its
ends; but that the life of a nation does express a general will, in
virtue of the fact that the individuals, who will private and less
general ends than the ends of the nation, live in a system of relations
that constitutes them an organism; and that it is in virtue of this
organic system of relations that the individual volitions work out
to an unforeseen unpurposed resultant, which he calls the end willed
by the general will. He makes of this organic unity the essential
difference between a mere crowd and a society or nation&mdash;defining
an organism or organic unity as a system of parts the capacities and
functions of each of which are determined by the general nature and
principle of the whole group.</p>

<p>That is an excellent definition of an organism; and we have
recognised fully the importance of organisation in national life,
consisting in specialisation of the parts such that each part is adapted
to perform some one function that subserves the life of the whole,
while itself dependent upon the proper functioning of all other parts.</p>

<p>We may admit too that, in proportion as this specialisation of
functions is carried further, organic unity is promoted because
the life of the whole becomes more intimately dependent on the life
of each part, and each part more intimately and completely dependent
on the life of the whole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>But unity of this sort is characteristic of all animal bodies; and,
though the mind has this kind of organic unity, it acquires, in proportion
as self-consciousness develops, over and above this kind of
unity, a unity of an altogether new and unique kind; a unity which
consists in the whole (or the self) being present to consciousness,
whether clearly or obscurely, during almost every moment of thought,
and pervading and playing some part in the determination of the
course of thought and action.</p>

<p>Now, the national mind also has both the lower and the higher
kinds of unity. In both cases&mdash;that is, in the development both of
the individual and of the national mind&mdash;a certain degree of organic
unity must be achieved, before self-consciousness can develop and
begin to play its part; but in both cases, when once it has begun
to operate, self-consciousness goes on greatly to increase the organic
unity, to increase the specialisation of functions and the systematic
interdependence of the parts.</p>

<p>Consider a single illustration of this parallelism of the individual
with the national mind. Take the aesthetic faculty. In the individual
mind there develops a certain capacity for finding pleasure in certain
objects and impressions, such as young children and even the animals
have; and then, with the growth of self-consciousness, the individual
sets himself deliberately to cultivate this faculty, to specialise it
along particular lines and to exercise it as something apart from his
other mental functions; while, nevertheless, it becomes for him, in
proportion as it is developed and specialised, more and more an
essential part of his total experience. Just so there spontaneously
develop in a people some rudimentary aesthetic practices and traditions
and some class of persons, say the bards, who are more skilled
than other men in ministering to the aesthetic demands of their
fellows. Then, as national self-consciousness develops, the place
and value of these functions in the system of national life becomes
explicitly recognised, and they are deliberately fostered by the
establishment of national institutions, schools of art, academies of
letters and music, the award of public titles and honours and so
forth; whereby the specialisation of these national functions is
increased, their dependence on the life of the whole rendered more
intimate, and, at the same time, the life of the whole rendered more
dependent upon the life of these parts, because the richer aesthetic
development of the parts reacts upon the whole, diffusing itself
through and elevating the life of the whole.</p>

<p>Bosanquet recognises in national life only the lower kind of unity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and not the unity of self-consciousness. He seems to reject the
notion of national self-consciousness, on the ground that the life
of a nation is so complex that it cannot be fully and adequately
reflected in the consciousness of any individual; yet in this respect
the difference between the national mind and the individual mind
is one of degree only and not of kind. In the individual mind also,
even the most highly developed and self-conscious, the capacities
and dispositions and tendencies that make up the whole mind are
never fully and adequately present to consciousness; the individual
never knows himself exhaustively, though he may continually progress
towards a more nearly complete self-knowledge. Just so the
national mind may progress towards a more complete self-knowledge,
and, though at the present time no nation has attained more than
a very imperfect self-knowledge, yet the process is accelerating
rapidly among the more advanced nations; and such increasing
self-knowledge promises to become the dominating factor in the
life of nations, as it is in the lives of all men, save the most
primitive.</p>

<p>Suppose that all those conditions making for national unity
which we have considered in the foregoing chapters were realised,
but that nevertheless all men continued to be moved only by self-regarding
motives, or by those which have reference to the welfare
of themselves and their family circle or to any ends less comprehensive
than the welfare of the whole nation. We could not then
properly speak of the tendencies resulting from the interplay and
the conflict of all these individual wills as expressions of the general
will, as Bosanquet and others have done, even though the organic
unity of the whole secured a harmonious resultant national activity,
if such a thing were possible. But there is no reason to suppose that
such a thing is possible.</p>

<p>I think we may say that it is only in so far as the idea of the
people or nation as a whole is present to the consciousness of individuals
and determines their actions that a nation in the proper
sense of the word can exist or ever has existed. Without this factor
any population inhabiting a given territory remains either a mere
horde or a population of slaves under a despotism. Neither
can be called a nation; wherever a nation has appeared in the
history of the world, the consciousness of itself as a nation has
been an essential condition of its existence and still more of its
progress.</p>

<p>We may see this, even more clearly, in the case of the smaller
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
aggregations of men, the smaller social units, the family, the clan,
the tribe. The family is a family only so long as it is conscious of
itself as a family, and only in virtue of that self-consciousness and of
the part which this idea and the sentiments gathered about it play
in determining the actions of each member. How carefully such
family consciousness is sometimes fostered and how great a part it
plays in social life is common knowledge. In the early stages of
Greek and Roman history, the family consciousness was the dominant
social force which long succeeded in overriding and preventing the
development of any larger social consciousness. Just as the <i>gens</i>
played this part in early Rome, so the clan has played a similar
part elsewhere, for example in the highlands of Scotland. Such
peoples form the strongest nations.</p>

<p>Just so with the tribe. It exists as a tribe only because, and in
so far as, it is conscious of itself, and in so far as the idea of the
tribe and devotion to its service determines the actions of individuals.
The mere fact of the possession of a tribal name suffices to prove
the existence of this self-consciousness. And, as a matter of fact,
tribal self-consciousness is in many cases extremely strongly developed;
the idea of the tribe, of its rights and powers, of its past
and its future plays a great part among warlike savages; and an
injury done to the tribe, or an insult offered to it, will often be
kept in mind for many years, even for generations, and will be
avenged when an opportunity occurs, even in spite of the certainty
of death to many individuals and the risk of extermination of the
whole tribe.</p>

<p>The federation of Iroquois tribes to form a rudimentary nation
seems to have been due to a self-conscious collective purpose. And,
when other tribes become fused to form nations, the same holds
true. Consider the Hebrew nation, one of the earliest historical
examples of a number of allied tribes becoming fused to a nation.
Surely the idea of the nation as the chosen people of Jehovah played
a vital part in its consolidation, implanted and fostered as it was
by a succession of great teachers, the prophets. Their work was
to implant this idea and this sentiment strongly in the minds of
the people, to create and foster this traditional sentiment by the
aid of supernatural sanctions. The national self-consciousness thus
formed has continued to be not only one factor, but almost the only
factor or condition, of the continued existence of the Jewish people
as a people, or at any rate the one fundamental condition on which
all the others are founded&mdash;their exclusive religion, their objection to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
intermarriage with outsiders, their hope of a future restoration of the
fortunes of the nation, and so forth.</p>

<p>And the same is true of every real nation; its existence and its
power are grounded in its consciousness of itself, the idea of the
nation as a dominant factor in the minds of the individuals. The
dominant sentiment which centres about that idea is very different
in the various nations. It may be chiefly pride in the nation&#8217;s past
history, as in Spain; or hope for its future, as in Japan; or the need
of self-assertion in the present, as in pre-war Germany.</p>

<p>The political history of Europe in the nineteenth century is
chiefly the history of the national actions that have sprung from
increase of national self-consciousness resulting from the spread of
education, from the improvement of means of communication within
each people and from increase of intercourse between nations. The
opening pages were the wars in which the French people, suddenly
aroused to an intense national consciousness, successfully resisted
and drove back all the other European powers. Of other leading
events the formation of modern Italy and of modern Germany, of
Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, were results of the awakening of national
self-consciousness<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p>The resistance of the Japanese to the Russians and their victory
over them were in the fullest sense the immediate outcome of the
idea of the Japanese nation in the minds of all its people, leading
to a strong collective volition for the greater power, glory, and
advancement of the nation. The recent unrest in China is recognised
on all hands to be the expression of a dawning national self-consciousness.
In Europe, Poland, Finland, Hungary, and Ireland exemplify
its workings very clearly in recent years. The Magyars were not
oppressed by the Austrians. They, economically and individually,
had nothing material to gain by a separation from Austria; and in
separating themselves they would have risked much, their lives, and
their material welfare; yet the idea of the Magyar nation impelled
them to it. The Poles of Germany were not rebellious because they
were ill-treated and their affairs maladministered. If they could and
would have cast out from their minds the idea of the Polish nation,
they might have comfortably shared in the marvellously advancing
material prosperity of Germany. But they were severely treated by the
Germans, because they were moved by this idea and this sentiment;
and the bad treatment it brought upon them did but render the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
idea more vividly, more universally, present to the consciousness of
all, even of the little children at school, and, by inflaming the
passions which have their root in the national sentiment, strengthened
that sentiment.</p>

<p>But for the idea of the Boer nation and the dawning national
sentiment, the late Boer war would never have occurred; and that
sentiment was, as in the case of the Japanese in their late war, the
principal source of the great energy displayed by the Boers and of
such success as they achieved.</p>

<p>Even in India, the proposal to divide Bengal has suddenly discovered
among the Bengalese, the most submissive part of the
population, the part which has seemed most devoid of national
spirit, the existence and the importance as a political factor of the
idea of the Bengalese as a people and of sentiments centred upon
that idea.</p>

<p>The rapid increase of national self-consciousness among the
peoples of the world and the increasing part everywhere played by
the sentiment for national existence are in short the dominant facts
in the present period of world history; their influence overshadows
all others.</p>

<p>Since, then, any nation exists only in virtue of the existence of
the idea of the nation in the minds of the individuals of whom it
is composed, and in virtue of the influence of this idea upon their
actions, and since this idea plays so great a part in shaping the
history of the world, it is absurd to maintain that the general
will is but the blind resultant of the conflict of individual wills
striving after private ends and unconscious of the ends or purposes
of the nation. In opposition to such a view, we must maintain that a
population seeking only individual ends cannot form or continue to
be a nation, though all the other conditions we have noticed be
present; that a nation is real and vigorous in proportion as its consciousness
of its self is full and clear. In fact national progress and
power and success depend in chief part upon the fulness and the
extension, the depth and width of this self-consciousness&mdash;the accuracy
and fulness with which each individual mind reflects the whole;
and upon the strength of the sentiments which are centred upon it
and which lead men to act for the good of the whole, to postpone
private to public ends. And the same holds good of all the many
forms of corporate life within the nation. Each individual&#8217;s sense of
duty, in so far as it is a true sense of duty, and not a fictitious sense
due merely to superstitious fear or to habit formed by suggestion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and compulsion, is chiefly founded upon the consciousness of
the society of which he forms a part, upon the group spirit that
binds him to his fellows and makes him one with them. And the
nations in which this national self-consciousness is strongest and
most widely diffused will be the successful nations.</p>

<p>Reflect a little on these facts vouched for by General Sir Ian
Hamilton. No soldier of the Japanese army, none even of the coolies,
would accept anything in the shape of a tip even for honest services
rendered, lest the purity of his motives should be sullied; and each
man always went into action not merely prepared to die if necessary,
but actually prepared and expecting to conquer and to die for the
good and glory of his nation. He writes &#8220;Japanese officers have
constantly to explain to their men that they must not consider the
main object of the battle is to get killed<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.&#8221; And he goes on to show
that they are not fanatics, are not inspired by any idea of the supernatural
or by any hope of rewards after death, as is usually the case
of the Moslem soldier who displays an equal recklessness of life.
Surely, if in any nation the national consciousness could inspire and
maintain all classes of its people in all relations of life to this high
level of strenuous self-sacrifice for the welfare of the nation, that
nation would soon predominate over all others, and be impregnably
strong, no matter what defects of individual and national character
it might display.</p>

<p>The idea of the nation is, then, a bond between its members
over and above all those bonds of custom, of habit, of economic
interdependence, of law and of self-interest, of sympathy, of imitation,
of collective emotion and thought, which inevitably arise among
a homogeneous people occupying any defined area; and it is the
most powerful and essential of them all. As Fouill&eacute;e put it, the
essential characteristic of human society is that &#8220;it is an organism
which realises itself in conceiving and in willing its own existence.
Any collection of men becomes a society in the only true sense of
the word, when all the men conceive more or less clearly the type
of organic whole which they can form by uniting themselves and
when they effectively unite themselves under the determining influence
of this conception. Society is then an organism which exists
because it has been thought and willed, it is an organism born of
an idea<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.&#8221; In this sense Society has never yet been perfectly realized,
but it is the ideal towards which social evolution tends.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>National group self-consciousness plays, then, an all-important
part in the life of nations, is in fact the actual, the most essential
constitutive factor of every nation; and nationhood or the principal
of nationality is the dominant note of world history in the present
epoch; that is to say, the desire and aspiration to achieve nationhood,
or to strengthen and advance the life of the nation, is the most
powerful motive underlying the collective actions of almost all
civilised and even of semi-civilised mankind; and the consequent
rivalry between nations overshadows every other feature of modern
world history, and is convulsing and threatening to destroy the whole
of modern civilisation. It is surely well worthy of serious study. Yet,
owing to the backward and neglected state of psychology, not only
is this study neglected, but, as we have seen, some of our leading
political philosophers have not yet even realized the essential nature
of the problem; and many of the historians, economists and political
writers are even further from a grasp of its nature. They have been
forced by the prominence and urgency of the facts to recognise what
they call the principle of nationality; and even now the majority
of them are demanding that, in the European settlement and in the
affairs of the world in general, the principle of nationality shall be
given the leading place and the decisive voice. But they do not
recognise that the understanding of this principle, this all-powerful
political factor, is primarily and purely a psychological problem.
We find them, in discussing the nature of nations and the conditions
of nationality, perhaps mentioning the psychological view of
nations as a curious aberration of a few academic cranks, from which
they turn to discover the true secret of nationality in such considerations
as geographical boundaries, race, language, history,
and above all economic factors; they do not see that each and
all of these conditions, real and important though they are and have
been in shaping the history and determining the existence of nations,
only play their parts indirectly by affecting men&#8217;s minds, their
beliefs, opinions, and sentiments, especially by favouring or repressing
the development in each people of the idea of the nation.</p>

<p>The all-dominant influence of the idea of the nation, I insist,
is not a theory or a speculative suggestion, it is a literal and obvious
fact. Let every other one of the favouring conditions of nationality,
the geographical, historical, economic be realised by a population;
yet, if that population has no collective self-consciousness, is not
strongly actuated to collective volition by the group spirit, it will
remain not a nation, but a mere aggregate of individuals, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
more or less organic unity due to the differentiation and interdependence
of its parts, but lacking that higher bond of unity which
alone can ensure its stability and continuity, and which, especially,
can alone enable it to withstand and survive the peaceful pressure
or the warlike impact of true nations.</p>

<p>I am not at present defending nationality; I shall come back to
the question of its value. I am now only concerned with the psychological
problem of the nature and conditions of the development of
national self-consciousness. I have been using the latter phrase and
the phrase &#8216;the idea of the nation&#8217; as a shorthand expression; but I
must remind the reader that we have to beware of the intellectualist
error of regarding ideas as moving powers; ideas as merely intellectual
representations or conceptions have no motive power, they are in
themselves indifferent. It is only in so far as the object conceived
becomes the object of some sentiment that the conception of it
moves us strongly to feeling and action. I must refer, therefore, to
what I have written on the sentiments and the self-regarding sentiment<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.
Here I would insist on the strictness in this point of our
analogy between the individual and the national mind. I have
pointed out that the individual&#8217;s idea of himself only develops
beyond a rudimentary stage in virtue of and in so far as this idea
becomes the nucleus of a strong self-regarding sentiment which gives
him an interest in himself, directs his attention upon his own personality
and its relations, and impels him to strive to know himself.
So that a developed individual self-consciousness never is and never
can be a purely intellectual growth, but always involves a strong
sentiment, a centering of emotional conative tendencies upon this
object, the self. Exactly the same is true of nations.</p>

<p>Hence national self-consciousness can never develop except in
the form of an idea of strong affective tone, that is to say a sentiment.
Hence, whenever we speak of national self-consciousness or
the idea of the nation as a powerful factor in its life, the sentiment
is implied, and I have implied it when using these expressions
hitherto. This national sentiment, which, if we use the word in its
widest sense, may be called patriotism, is, like all the other group
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
sentiments, developed by way of extension of the self-regarding
sentiment of the individual to the group, and may be further
complicated and strengthened by the inclusion of other tendencies.
A point of especial importance is that this great group sentiment
can hardly be developed otherwise than by way of extension of
sentiments for smaller included groups, the family especially. For the
idea of the nation is too difficult for the grasp of the child&#8217;s mind, and
cannot, therefore, become the object of a sentiment until the intellectual
powers are considerably developed. Hence the development of a
family sentiment, or of one for some other small easily conceived
group, is essential for the development in the child of those modes
of mental action which are involved in all group feeling and action.
For this reason the family is the surest, perhaps essential, foundation
of national life; and national self-consciousness is strongest,
where family life is strongest.</p>

<p>The development of the group spirit in general and of national
self-consciousness in particular is favoured by, and indeed dependent
upon, conditions similar to those which develop the self-consciousness
of individuals. Here is another striking point of the analogy between
the individual and the national mind. Passing over other conditions,
let us notice one, the most important of all. The individual&#8217;s
consciousness of self is developed chiefly by intercourse with
other individuals&mdash;by imitation, by conflict, by compulsion, and by
co-operation. Without such intercourse it must remain rudimentary.
The individual&#8217;s conception of himself is perpetually extended by his
increasing knowledge of other selves; and his knowledge of those
other selves grows in the light of his knowledge of himself. There
is perpetual reciprocal action. The same is true of peoples. A population
living shut off, isolated from the rest of the world, within
which no distinctions of tribe and race existed, would never become
conscious of itself as one people and, therefore, would not become a
nation. Some such conditions obtained for long ages among the
pastoral hordes of the central Eurasian Steppes, which, so long as
they remained there, have never formed a nation; and the same was
true of the tribes of Arabia, until Mahomet impelled them by his
religion of the sword to hurl themselves upon neighbouring peoples.</p>

<p>Of civilised peoples, China has had least intercourse with the
outer world. The Chinese knew too little of other races to imitate
them; they did not come into conflict or co-operation with others,
save in a very partial manner at long intervals of time, or only with
their Mongol conquerors, whom they despised as inferior to them in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
everything but warfare, and whom they abhorred. Hence, in spite of
the homogeneity of the people, of the common culture, and of the
vast influence of great teachers, national consciousness and the group
spirit in all its forms remained at a low level. Hence, a great deficiency
in those virtues which have their root in the social consciousness;
a low standard of public duty, a lack of the sense of
obligation to society. Hence, the corruptness and hollowness
of all official transactions and political life. Want of honesty in
public affairs is not the expression of an inherent defect of the
Chinese character; for in commercial relations with Europeans
the Chinaman has proved himself extremely trustworthy, much
superior indeed in this respect to some other peoples. It is
probable that, if China, like Europe, had long ago been divided into
a number of nations, each of them, through action and reaction
upon the rest, would have developed a much fuller national consciousness
than exists at present and some considerable degree of
public spirit and would consequently have advanced very much
farther in the scale of social evolution, instead of standing still as
the whole people has done for so long.</p>

<p>Everywhere we can see the illustrations of this law. Of all forms
of intercourse, conflict and competition are the most effective in developing
national consciousness and character, because they bring
a common purpose to the minds of all individuals; and that is the
condition of the highest degree and effectiveness of collective mental
action and volition. It is under these conditions that the idea of
the nation and the will to protect it and to forward its interests
become predominant in the minds of individuals; and the more so
the greater the public danger, the greater and the more obvious the
need for the postponement of private ends to the general end.</p>

<p>Already there is beginning to develop a European self-consciousness
and a European purpose, provoked by the demonstration of the
hitherto latent power of Asia; and, if a federation of European
peoples is ever to be realised, it will be the result of their further
development through opposition to a great and threatening Asiatic
power, a revived Moslem empire, or possibly a threatened American
domination<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>Although war has hitherto been the most important condition of
the development of national consciousness, it is not the only one;
and it remains to be seen whether industrial or other forms of rivalry
can play a similar part. Probably, industrial rivalry cannot; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
accumulation of wealth is too largely dependent upon the accidents
of material conditions to become a legitimate source of national
satisfaction; for, unlike the satisfaction arising from successful exertion
of military power, it does not imply intrinsic superiorities. If
the natural conditions of material prosperity could be equalised for
all nations, then the acquisition of superior wealth, implying as it
would superior capacities, might become a sufficiently satisfying
end of national action; just as the equalisation of conditions among
individuals in America has for the present rendered the accumulation
of wealth a sufficient end, because such accumulation implies superior
powers and is the mark of personal superiority.</p>

<p>Other forms of rivalry&mdash;rivalry in art, science, letters, in efficiency
of social and political organisation, even in games and sports, all
play some part; and it is possible that together they might suffice
to constitute sufficient stimulus, even though the possibility of war
should be for ever removed<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>But national self-consciousness is not developed by conflict and
rivalry only. It is refined and enriched by all other forms of intercourse.
In studying other peoples, their organisation and their
history, we become more clearly aware of the defects and the
qualities and potentialities of our own nation. And in this way,
refinement of national consciousness is now going on rapidly in
the European peoples. The latest considerable advance is due to
the observation of Japan; for this has clearly demonstrated the
imperfection of many conceptions that were current among us and
has brought a certain abatement of national complacency and a
greater earnestness of national self-criticism, which is highly favourable
to increase of national self-knowledge<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>We might place nations in a scale of nationhood. The scale
would correspond roughly to one in which they were arranged according
to the degree to which the public good is the end, and the
desire of it the motive, of men&#8217;s actions; this in turn would correspond
to a scale in which they were arranged according to the
degree of development and diffusion of the national consciousness,
of the idea of the nation or society as a whole; and this again to
one in which they were arranged according to the degree of intercourse
they have had with other nations. At the bottom of the
scale would stand the people of Thibet, the most isolated people of
the world; near them the Chinese, who also have until recently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
been almost entirely excluded from international intercourse.
Such peoples have a national consciousness and sentiment which
is extremely vague and imperfect. They do not realise their weakness,
their strength or their potentialities, but have an unenlightened
pride without aspiration for a higher form of national life.
A little above them would stand Russia, which has remained for so
long outside the area of European international life. While at the top
of the scale would be those nations which have borne their part in all
the strain and stress and friction of European rivalry and intercourse.</p>

<p>These degrees of international intercourse have been very largely
determined by geographical conditions; isolation, and consequent
backwardness in national evolution, being in nearly every case due
to remoteness of position. The most important factor of modern
times making for more rapid social evolution is probably the practical
destruction or overcoming of the barriers between peoples; for thus
all peoples are brought into the international arena, and their national
spirit is developed through international intercourse and rivalry.</p>

<p>It is this increasing contact and intercourse of peoples, brought
about by the increased facilities of communication, which has
quickened the growth of national self-consciousness throughout all
the world and has made the principle of nationality or, more properly,
the desire for nationhood and for national existence and development,
for self-assertion and for international recognition, the
all-important feature of modern times, overshadowing every other
phenomenon that historians have to notice, or statesmen to reckon
with.</p>

<p>The American nation is interesting in this connexion. If we ask&mdash;Why
is their public life on a relatively low level, in spite of so many
favouring conditions, including a healthy and strong public opinion?&mdash;the
answer is that they have been until recently too much shut off
from collective intercourse with other nations, too far removed from
the region of conflict and rivalry. And judicious well-wishers of the
American nation rejoice that it has recently entered more fully into
the international arena, and has not continued to pursue the policy
of isolation, which was long in favour; because, as is already manifest,
this fuller intercourse and intenser rivalry with other nations must
render fuller and more effective their national spirit, develop the
national will and raise the national life to a higher plane, giving
to individuals higher ends and motives than the mere accumulation
of wealth, and removing that self-complacency as regards their
national existence which hitherto has characterised them in common
with the peoples of Thibet and China.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h4>IDEAS IN NATIONAL LIFE</h4>

<p>We have seen that the idea of the nation can and does, in virtue of
the formation of the sentiment of devotion to it, lead men to choose
and decide and act for the sake of the nation; they desire the welfare
and the good of the nation as a whole, they value its material
prosperity and its reputation in the eyes of other nations; and, in
so far as the decisions and actions of a nation proceed from this
motive, co-operating with and controlling other motives in the minds
of its members, such decision and action are the expressions of true
collective volition.</p>

<p>It is truly volition because it conforms to the true type of volition.
Individual volition can only be marked off from every impulsive
action and every lower form of effort, by the fact that in true
volition, among all the impulses or motives that may impel a man
to action or decision, the dominant r&ocirc;le is played by a motive that
springs from his self-regarding sentiment. This motive is a desire to
achieve a particular end, which, viewed as the achievement of the
self, brings him satisfaction, because the thought of himself achieving
this end is in harmony with the ideal of the self which he has
gradually built up and has learnt to desire to realize under the
influence of his social setting. The same is true of national volition.</p>

<p>And it is collective volition in so far as the deliberations by
which the decision of the nation has been reached have been
effected through those formally and informally organised relations
and channels of communication and by means of all the various
modes of interaction of persons by which public opinion is formed
and in which it is guided and controlled by the living traditions of
the nation.</p>

<p>That this is the true nature of national volition may be more
clearly realized on considering some instances of national action which
could not properly be called the expression of the will of the Nation.
A tariff might be adopted because a large number of men desired it,
each in order that he himself might get rich more quickly; and, even
though a large majority, or even all men, desired it, each for his private
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
end, it would not be the expression of the national will, it would not
be due to collective volition; it would be the expression of the will
of all. Nor would it be an expression of the national will, even if
each believed that, not only he, but also all his fellows would be
enriched, and if he desired it for that reason also; that would be an
expression of the will of all for the good of all. Only if and in so
far as the decision was reached through the influence of those who
desired it, because it seemed to them to be for the good of the
whole nation, would it be the expression of the will of the nation.</p>

<p>And the difference would be not merely a difference of motive;
the difference might be very important in respect both of the
deliberative processes by which the decision was reached and also
in respect of its ultimate consequences. For the will of all for the
good of all would have reference only to the immediate future;
whereas the truly national will would be influenced not only by
consideration of the good of all existing citizens, but, in an even
greater degree, by the thought of the continued welfare of the whole
nation, in the remote future.</p>

<p>Again, suppose that, on the occasion of an insult or injury to the
nation (I remind the reader of the incident in the North Sea when
the Russian fleet fired on our fishing boats), a wave of anger against
the offending nation sweeps over the whole country and that this
outburst of popular fury plunges the nation into war. That would be
collective mental process, but not volition; it would be action on
the plane of impulse or desire, unregulated by reflection upon the
end proposed in relation to the welfare of the nation and by the
motives to action that are stirred by such reflection.</p>

<p>Again, suppose a nation of which every member was patriotic,
and suppose that some proposed national action were pondered upon
by each man apart in his own chamber, without consultation and
discussion with his fellows in public and private. Then, though the
decision would be true volition, in so far as it was determined by each
man&#8217;s desire for the national welfare, it yet would not be collective
or national volition; because not reached by collective deliberation.</p>

<p>We have seen that the idea of the nation, present to the minds
of the mass of its members, is an essential condition of the nation&#8217;s
existence in any true sense of the word nation; that the idea alone
as an intellectual apprehension cannot exert any large influence;
that it determines judgment and action only in virtue of the sentiment
which grows up about this object&mdash;a sentiment which is
transmitted and fostered from generation to generation, just because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
it renders the nation an object of value. The consideration should be
obvious enough; but it has commonly been ignored by philosophers
of the intellectualist school. They treat the individual mind as a
system of ideas; they ignore the fact that it has a conative side
which has its own organisation, partially distinct from, though not
independent of, the intellectual side; and consequently they ignore
equally the fact that the national mind has its conative organisation.</p>

<p>Imagine a people in whom anti-nationalism (in the form of
cosmopolitanism, syndicalism or philosophic anarchism) had spread,
until this attitude towards the nation-state as such had become
adopted by half its members, while the other half remained patriotic.
Then there would be acute conflict and discussion, and the idea of
the nation would be vividly present to all minds; but the nature of
the sentiment attached to it would be different and opposite in the
two halves; one of attachment and devotion in the one half; of dislike,
aversion, or at least indifference (i.e. lack of sentiment) in the other
half. And the efforts of the one half to maintain the nation as a
unit would be antagonised and perhaps rendered nugatory by the
indifference or opposition of the other half, who would always seek
to break down national boundaries and would refuse co-operation
in any national action, and who would league themselves with bodies
of similar interests and anti-national tendencies in other countries.
Then, even though all might be well-meaning people desiring the
good of mankind, the nation would be very greatly weakened and
probably would soon cease to exist as such.</p>

<p>The illustration shews the importance of the distinction which
Rousseau did not draw in his discussion of the general will&mdash;namely,
the distinction between the good of all and the good of the whole,
i.e. of the nation as such. It might be argued that the distinction is
purely verbal; it might be said that, if you secure the good of all,
you thereby <i>ipso facto</i> secure the good of the whole, because the
whole consists of the sum of existing individuals; and that this is
obvious, because, if you take them away, no whole remains. But
to argue thus is to ignore the fact on which we have already insisted&mdash;namely,
that the whole is much more than the sum of the
existing units, because it has an indefinitely long future before it
and a part to play, through indefinitely long periods of time, as a
factor in the general welfare and progress of mankind.</p>

<p>So much greater is the whole than the sum of its existing parts,
that it might well seem right to sacrifice the welfare and happiness
of one or two or more generations, and even the lives of the majority
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of the citizens, if that were necessary to the preservation and future
welfare of the whole nation as such. This is no merely theoretical
distinction, it is one of the highest practical importance, which we
may illustrate in two ways.</p>

<p>A whole nation may be confronted with the alternative, may be
forced to choose between the good of all and the good of the
whole. Such a choice was, it may be said without exaggeration,
suddenly presented to the Belgian people, and only less acutely to
ourselves and to Italy, by the recent European conflagration; and
in each case the good of the whole has been preferred. Is it not
probable and obvious that, if each or all of these peoples had consented
to the domination of Germany, the material welfare of all
their existing citizens might well have been increased, rather than
diminished, and that their choice has involved not only the loss of
life of large numbers of their citizens and great sufferings for nearly
all the others, but also enormous sacrifice of material prosperity, in
order that the whole may survive and eventually prosper as a nation
working out its national destiny free from external domination?
There are, or were, those who say that they would just as soon live
under German rule, because they would be governed at least as well
and perhaps better than by their own government hitherto; and
there is perhaps nothing intrinsically bad or wrong in this attitude;
the question of its rightness or wrongness turns wholly on the valuation
of nationality. It is easier to appreciate this plea on behalf of
another people than our own. One may hear it said even now that,
after all, it would have been better for Belgium that she should have
entered into the group of Germanic powers in some sort of federal
system or Customs union; that, in general, it is ridiculous that the
small states should claim sovereign powers and pretend to have
their own foreign policy and so forth; that they are struggling
against the inevitable, against a universal and necessary tendency
for the absorption of the smaller states by the larger.</p>

<p>We may illustrate the difference between regard for the good of
all members of the nation and of the nation itself in another
way&mdash;namely, by reference to socialism, the principle which would
abolish inequalities of wealth and opportunity, as far as possible,
by abolishing or greatly restricting the rights of private property
and capital, especially the right of inheritance. There can, I think,
be little doubt that the adoption of socialism in this sense by
almost any modern nation would increase the well being and
happiness of its members very decidedly on the whole for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
present generation and possibly for some generations to come. It
is in respect of the continued welfare of the whole and of its perpetuation
as an evolving and progressing organism that the effects
seem likely to be decidedly bad. The socialists are in the main
those who fix their desire and attention on the good of all; hence
they are for the most part inclined to set a low value on nationality,
even while they demand a vast extension of the functions of the
State, conceived as an organised system of administration. Those,
on the other hand, who repudiate socialism, not merely because they
belong to the class of &#8216;Haves,&#8217; must seek their justification in the
consideration of the probable effects of such a change on the welfare
of the nation conceived as an organism whose value far transcends
the lives of the present generation.</p>

<p>When, then, we attribute to the idea of the nation or to the
national consciousness this all-important creative, constitutive, and
conservative function, we must be clear that the idea is not an
intellectual conception merely, but implies an enduring emotional
conative attitude which is the sentiment of devotion to the nation;
and, further, we must remember that the nation means not simply all
existing individuals, the mere momentary embodiment of the nation,
but something that is far greater, because it includes all the potentialities
embodied in the existing persons and organisation.</p>

<p>It is the presence and operation in the national mind of the idea
of the nation in the extended sense just indicated that gives to
national decisions and actions the character of truly collective volitions;
they approach this type more nearly, the more the idea is
rich in meaning and adequate or true, and the more widely it is
spread, and the more powerful and widely spread is the sentiment
which attaches value to the nation and sways men to decision
and action for the sake of the whole, determining the issue among
all other conflicting motives.</p>

<p>And it is the working of the national spirit and the acceptance
of and devotion to the national organisation which render the
submission of the minority to the means chosen by the majority
a voluntary submission; for it is of the essence of that organisation
that, while all accept and will the same most general end, namely
the welfare of the whole, the choice of means must be determined
by the judgment of the majority, formed and expressed as a collective
judgment and opinion by way of all the many channels of
reciprocal influence that the national organisation, both formal
and informal, provides. In so far as each man holds this attitude,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
esteeming the nation and accepting loyally its constitution or
organisation, the decision determined by even a bare majority vote
of parliament becomes the expression of the national will; and
the co-operation in carrying it out of those who did not judge the
method to be wise, and who therefore voted against it, yet becomes a
truly voluntary co-operation, in so far as they accept the established
organisation.</p>

<p>The point may be illustrated by the instance of a nation going to
war. A large minority may be against war, for reasons which to them
may seem to be of the highest kind; it may be that they judge the
nation to be morally in the wrong in the matter in dispute, or very
questionably in the right, as many Englishmen did during the Boer
War; and yet, if, by the accepted organised channels of national
deliberation and decision, war has been declared, then, although it
was their duty to do what they could to make their opinion prevail
before the decision was reached, there is no moral inconsistency in
their supporting the war measures with all their strength. It is in
fact implied in their loyalty, if they are loyal and patriotic, that
they shall yield their individual opinion to the expression of the
national will and shall accept the means chosen to the common end.
That is the truth implied in the phrase&mdash;My country right or wrong.
Of course, this phrase may be taken in a reprehensible sense, as
meaning that any opportunity of forwarding the immediate interests
of one&#8217;s country must be taken, regardless of the interests of other
communities and of the obligations of common honesty and humanity
upon which all human welfare depends.</p>

<p>In the same way, a man might disapprove of a particular tax,
say on liquor, or of obligatory military service; and yet he may
accept the national will and serve faithfully as a soldier, without
inconsistency, and without ceasing to be a free agent truly willing
the acts imposed by his position in the whole organisation; just as
during the late war many priests served as soldiers in the French
army. Or, to take an extreme instance, a man who has broken the law
and even incurred the death penalty may be truly said to undergo
his punishment of imprisonment or death as a morally free agent,
if he is loyal to his country and its institutions, accepting the penalty,
while yet believing his action to be right. Such perfect loyalty to
the nation is of course rare; and in all actual nations men have
progressed towards it in very different degrees. Most existing nations
have emerged from preceding despotisms by the repeated widening
of the sphere of freedom, as the growth of loyalty in strength and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
extension rendered such freedom consistent with the survival of the
State and its administrative functions.</p>

<p>Thus a people progresses from the status of an organism, in which
the parts are subordinated to the whole without choice or free
volition on their part, or even against their wills, towards the ideal
of a Nation-state, an organic whole which is founded wholly upon
voluntary contract between each member and the whole, and in
which the distinction between the State and the nation becomes
gradually overcome and replaced by identity. For, as national self-consciousness
develops and each man conceives more fully and clearly
the whole nation and his place and function in it, and grows in
loyalty to the nation, he ceases to obey the laws merely because he
is constrained by the authority and force of the State. An increasing
proportion of citizens obey the law and render due services
voluntarily, because they perceive that, in so doing, they are contributing
towards the good of the whole which they value highly;
in so far as they act in this spirit, the actions and restraints prescribed
by law become their voluntary actions and restraints.</p>

<p>Thus the theory that society is founded upon a <i>Social Contract</i>,
which, if taken as a description of the historical process of genesis,
is false, is true, if accepted as the constitutive principle of the ideal
State towards which progressive nations are tending.</p>

<p>And, as the organisation of a nation becomes less dependent
upon outer authority and upon mere custom and the unreasoning
acceptance of tradition, and more and more upon free consent and
voluntary contract, the nation does not cease to be an organism;
it retains that formal and informal organisation which has developed
in large part without the deliberate guidance of the collective
will and which is essential to its collective life; the national mind,
as it grows in force and extension and understanding of its own
organisation, accepts those features which it finds good, and
gradually modifies those which appear less good in the light of its
increasing self knowledge; and so it tends more and more to become
a contractual organism, which, as Fouill&eacute;e has insisted, is the highest
type of society.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that this ideal of the contractual organism
synthesises the two great doctrines or theories of society which have
generally been regarded as irreconcilable alternatives: the doctrine
of society as an organism, and that of society as founded upon reason
and free will. They have been treated as opposed and irreconcilable
doctrines, because those who regarded society as an organism, taking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the standpoint of natural science, have laid stress upon its evolution
by biological accidents and by the interaction and conflict of many
blind impulses and purely individual volitions, in which collective
volition, governed by an ideal of the form to be achieved, had no
part. While, on the other hand, the idealist philosophers, describing
society or the nation as wholly the work of reason and free will,
have been guilty of the intellectualist fallacy of regarding man as
a purely rational being; they have ignored the fact that all men,
even the most intellectual, are largely swayed and moulded by
processes of suggestion, imitation, sympathy, and instinctive impulse,
in quite non-rational ways; and they have ignored still more completely
the fact that the operation of these non-rational processes
continues to be not only of immense influence but also inevitable
and necessary to the maintenance of that organic unity of society
upon which as a basis the contract-unity is superimposed as a bond
of a higher, more rational and more spiritual quality.</p>

<p>The former doctrine logically tends to the paralysis of social
effort and to the adoption of extreme individualism, to the doctrine
of each man for himself, and of <i>laissez faire</i>, doctrines such as those
of Herbert Spencer. The other, the idealist theory of the state as
being founded and formed by reason, tends equally logically towards
extreme State socialism; because its overweening belief in reason
leads it to ignore the large and necessary basis of subrational organisation
and operation.</p>

<p>Only a synthesis of the two in the doctrine of the contractual
organism can reconcile them and give us the ideal of a nation in
which the maximum and perfection of organisation shall be combined
with the maximum of liberty, because in it each individual will be
aware of the whole and his place and functions in it, and will voluntarily
accept that place and perform those functions.</p>

<p>The highest, most perfectly organised and effective nation is,
then, not that in which the individuals are disposed of, their actions
completely controlled, and their wills suppressed by the power of
the State. It is, rather, one in which the self-consciousness and
initiative and volition of individuals, personality in short, is developed
to the highest degree, and in which the minds and wills of the
members work harmoniously together under the guidance and
pressure of the idea of the nation, rendered in the highest degree
explicit and full and accurate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Value Of Nationality</span></h4>

<p>At the present time, while the mass of men continue to accept
the duty of patriotism unquestioningly, and historians for the most
part are content to describe with some astonishment the immense
development of nationalism in the past century, many voices are
loudly raised for and against nationality. The great mass of men no
doubt are swept away in the flood of patriotic feeling. But the war
has also intensified the antipathy, and given increased force to the
arguments, of those who decry nationality and deprecate patriotism&mdash;for
these are but two different modes of expressing the same
attitude.</p>

<p>There are two principal classes of the anti-nationalists. First,
the philosophic anarchists, who would abolish all states and governments,
as unnecessary evils, men like Kropotkin and Tolstoi. Secondly,
the cosmopolitans, who, while believing in the necessity of
government and even demanding more centralised administration,
would yet abolish all national boundaries as far as possible, boundaries
of geography, of language, race and sentiment, and all national
governments, and would aim at the establishment of one great
world state.</p>

<p>Though the aims of these two parties are so widely different, they
use much the same arguments against nationalism. According to the
anti-nationalist view, nationalism and the patriotism in which it is
founded are a kind of disease of human nature, which, owing to the
unfortunate fact that mankind has retained the gregarious instinct
of his animal ancestors, inevitably breaks out as soon as any community
begins to come into free contact and rivalry with other
communities, and which tends to grow in force in a purely instinctive
and irrational manner the more these contacts and rivalries increase.</p>

<p>The liability to patriotism is thus regarded as closely comparable
with mankind&#8217;s unfortunate liability to drunkenness, to feel the fascination
of strong liquor&mdash;as merely a natural and inevitable result
or by-product of an unfortunate flaw in human nature&mdash;a tendency
which will have to be sternly repressed and, if possible, eradicated,
before men can hope to live in peace and tolerable security and to
develop their higher capacities.</p>

<p>The fact that patriotism of some degree and form is universally
displayed, and that it breaks out everywhere into heat and
flame when certain conditions are realized, does not for them in
any degree justify it; and it should not, they hold, reconcile us to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
its continued existence; they draw an indictment not merely
against a whole people, but against the whole human race. They
attack nationalism, firstly, by describing what in their opinion patriotism
is and whence it comes; secondly, by describing what they
believe to be the natural consequences and effects of nationalism.</p>

<p>The most common mode of attack is to identify patriotism with
jingoism; they speak of &#8220;jelly-bellied flag-flappers&#8221; of flag-wagging
and mafficking; they assert that the essence of patriotism
is hatred and all uncharitableness towards other countries and
their citizens.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Less virulent is the criticism of those who, looking coldly
upon patriotism, describe it as the mere blind expression of the
working of the gregarious instinct among us, and as something
therefore quite irrational, which must and will tend to disappear,
as men become more enlightened and are guided more by reason
and less by instinct.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Again, it is said that patriotism is a form of selfishness and
therefore bad; that it is a limitation of our sympathies, a principle
of injustice; that it stands in the way of the realisation of
universal justice, of the universal brotherhood of man, which is
the ideal we obviously must accept and aim at. Or in other
words, and this is the main indictment, it is alleged that patriotism
and nationalism inevitably tend to produce war, that
they keep the rival nations perpetually arming for possible wars
and actually in commercial and economic war, if not at real war.
And of course the evils of warfare and of such perpetual preparation
for war are great and obvious enough in modern Europe.
In support of this indictment, they point to the golden age of the
Roman Empire, when the inhabitants of all its parts were content
to sink their differences of race and country and were proud to
proclaim themselves citizens of the Roman Empire; and they say
that in consequence the civilised world attained then a pitch of
prosperity and contentment never known before or since over
any large area of the earth.</p>

<p>This is a formidable indictment, to which the exponents and
advocates of patriotism have for the most part been content to
reply by renewed exhortations to patriotism, by emotional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
appeals, by rhetoric, by the quotation of patriotic verses, the
citation of the glorious deeds of our armies and soldiers now and
in past times, by all the arts of persuasion and suggestion. As a
fine example of this method one may cite Mr Stratford Wingfield&#8217;s
<i>History of British Patriotism</i>, in which he not only confines himself
to these methods, but shows a positive dislike and contempt for
all attempts to apply reason and scientific method to the study
of human affairs.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In maintaining this attitude, the advocates of
patriotism give some colour to the claim of their opponents that
patriotism or nationalism is essentially irrational, in the sense
that it is incapable of justification by reason.</p>

<p>The politicians and historians, on the other hand, who are so
generally demanding that the European settlement after the war
must accept nationality as its fundamental principle, are commonly
content to note the strength and the wide distribution of the
patriotic sentiment, without enquiring into its origin, nature, or
value.</p>

<p>Let us examine the arguments against patriotism and then see
what reason can advance in its defence. For, though a rational
defence of patriotism will have little direct effect in making patriots,
we may be sure that, if such defence cannot be maintained,
patriotism will have to fight a losing battle.</p>

<p>In disparaging patriotism by describing it as the work of an
instinct, the gregarious or the pugnacious or other instinct, or of
several instincts, its critics are guilty of two psychological errors
and a popular fallacy. The last is the fallacy that the worth of any
thing is to be judged by the course from which it springs. Even if
patriotism were nothing more than the direct expression of the
gregarious instinct which we possess in common with many of
the higher animals, that would not in itself condemn it. But this
description of it, as a product of instinct as opposed to the principles
we attain by reason, involves that false disjunction and opposition
of reason to instinct which is traditional and which the intellectualist
philosophers commonly adopt, when they condescend to
recognise in any way the presence of instinctive tendencies in
human nature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>The other psychological error is the failure to recognize that
patriotism although, like all other great mental forces, it is rooted
in instinct, is not itself an instinct or the direct expression of any
instinct or group of instincts, but is rather an extremely complicated
sentiment, which has a long and complex history in each individual
mind in which it manifests itself; that it is, therefore, capable of
infinite variety and of an indefinite degree of intellectualisation and
refinement; that the cult of patriotism is, therefore, a field for
educational effort of the highest order, and that in this field moral
and intellectual education may achieve their noblest and most far-reaching
effects.</p>

<p>The psychological justification of patriotism has already been
indicated, but may be concisely stated here. The moral value of the
group spirit was considered in an earlier chapter; we saw how it,
and it alone, raises the conduct of the mass of men above the plane
of simple egoism or family selfishness. The sentiment of devotion or
loyalty to any group has this virtue in some degree; but loyalty to
the nation is capable of exalting character and conduct in a higher
degree than any other form of the group spirit. For the nation alone
has continuity of existence in the highest degree; a long past which
gives a large perspective of past history, involving the history of
long series of self-sacrificing efforts and many heroic actions; and the
prospect of an indefinitely prolonged future, with the possibility of continued
progress and development of every kind, and therefore some
security for the perpetuation of the results achieved by individual
efforts<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<p>Further, the nation alone, is a self-contained and complete
organism; other groups within it do but minister to the life of
the whole; their value is relative to that of the whole; the continuance
of results achieved on their behalf is dependent upon the
continued welfare of the whole (for example, the welfare of any class
or profession&mdash;a fact too easily overlooked by those in whom class
spirit grows strong). Hence, the nation, as an object of sentiment,
includes all smaller groups within it; and, when the nation is regarded
from an enlightened point of view, the sentiment for it naturally
comes to include in one great system all minor group sentiments
and to be strengthened by their incorporation.</p>

<p>It is important to notice also that, just as the minor group
sentiments are not incompatible with, but rather may strengthen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the national sentiment, when subordinated to and incorporated in
it, so the national sentiment is not incompatible with still more
widely inclusive group sentiments&mdash;for example, that for a European
system of nations, for the &#8216;League of Nations&#8217; or for Western Civilisation
in general. And, while loyalty to humanity as a whole is a
noble ideal, it is one which can only be realized through a further
step of that process of extension of the object of the group sentiment,
of which extension patriotism itself is the culmination at present
for the great mass of civilised mankind. The attempt to achieve it
by any other road is bound to fail because psychologically unsound<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p>Let us note in passing that neglect of this truth gives rise to two
of the extreme forms of political doctrine or ideal, current at the
present day; first, the ideal of the brotherhood of man in a nationless
world; secondly, the extreme form of democratic individualism which
assumes that the good of society is best promoted by the freest
possible pursuit by individuals of their private ends, which believes
that each man must have an equal voice in the government of his
country, because that is the only way in which his interests and those
of his class can be protected and forwarded; a doctrine which regards
public life as a mere strife of private and class interests. Both ideals
fly in the face of psychological facts; and, though they are in appearance
extreme opposites, they are apt to be found associated in
the same minds.</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, we have the philosophical conservatism
of such a thinker as Edmund Burke, which is keenly aware
of the organic unity of society and looks constantly to the good of
the whole, deriving from that consideration its leading motives and
principles, and which trusts principally to the growth of the group
spirit for the holding of the balance between conflicting interests
and for the promotion of the public welfare.</p>

<p>Having seen the importance for national life of the idea of the
nation, the diffusion of which through the minds of the people constitutes
national self-consciousness, let us glance for a moment at the
way other ideas may play leading r&ocirc;les in national life. Such are
ideas which became national ideals, that is to say, ideas of some
end to be realised by the nation which became widely entertained
and the objects of strong sentiments and of collective emotion and
desire and which, therefore, determine collective action.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to deal separately with various classes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
such ideas, or ideals&mdash;the political, the religious, the economic; but
shall only note the fact that they have played and may yet play
great parts in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Men are not swayed exclusively by considerations of material self-interest,
as the older school of economists generally assumed; nor
even by spiritual self-interest, as too much of the religious teaching
of the past has assumed; nor even by consideration of the welfare
of the social groups of which they are members. Many of the
great events of history have been determined by ideas that
have had no relation to individual welfare, but have inspired a
collective enthusiasm for collective action, for national effort, of
a disinterested kind; and the lives of some nations have been
dominated by some one or two such ideas. These ideas are first
conceived and taught by some great man, or by a few men who
have acquired prestige and influence; they then become generally
accepted by suggestion and imitation, accepted more or less uncritically
and established beyond the reach of argument and
reasoning.</p>

<p>No matter what the character of the idea, its collective acceptance
by a people enhances for the time the homogeneity of mind among
them, renders the people more intimately a unity, and serves also
to mark it off more sharply from other peoples among whom other
ideas prevail.</p>

<p>But, besides thus binding together at any period of its history the
people that entertains it the generally accepted idea, if it endures,
may produce further effects by becoming incorporated in the national
organisation; in so far as it determines the form of activity of the
people, it moulds their institutions and customs into harmony with
itself, until they become in some measure its embodiment and expression;
and in any vigorous nation there are usually one or two
dominant ideas at work in this way.</p>

<p>It is a favourite dogma with some writers (for example M. le Bon)
that ideas, before they can exert great effects in the life of a nation,
must first become unconscious ideas, incorporated as they say in
the unconscious soul of a people. This is an obscure confused
doctrine, which, if it is meant to be taken literally, we can
only reject. If it is to have any real meaning, it must be taken
in the sense that the long prevalence of the ideal moulds the institutions
and customs and the executive organisation of a people, so
that national action towards the ideal end becomes more or less
automatic or routine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>If the ideal so accepted and incorporated in the organised
structure of the national mind, is one that makes for strength and
at the same time permits of progress, it lives on; in other cases it
may destroy the nation, or petrify it, arresting all progress.</p>

<p>Consider one or two examples of ideas that have played dominant
r&ocirc;les in the lives of nations. They are mostly political, or religious,
or, most powerful of all, politico-religious. The idea of world-conquest
has dominated and has destroyed several great nations, of which
the latest example is the German Empire. The idea of conversion
by the sword, accepted with enthusiasm by the Arab nation, gave
it for a time tremendous energy, but contained no potency of
permanent power or of progress. The idea of immortality, or desire
of continued existence after death, seems to have dominated the
minds of the ancient Egyptian people; the idea of escape from the
evils of this world, those who have fully accepted Buddhism, like
the Burmans<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. The idea of caste as an eternal and impassable
barrier has largely determined the history of India.</p>

<p>All these are ideas which have proved ineffective to sustain
national vigour or to promote social evolution. It would not be
strictly true to say that the fall, or the unprogressive condition, of
the peoples that have entertained these ideas is the result of those
ideas; because the general acceptance of them proves that they
were in harmony with the type of mind of the people. Yet the
formulation of the ideas by the leading minds who impressed them
on the peoples must have accentuated those tendencies with which
they harmonised; and in each case, if the idea had never been
formulated, or if others had been effectively impressed on the mind
of the people, the course of its history would have been changed.
Of ideas less adverse to national life take the idea of ancestor
worship, and the idea of personal loyalty to the ruler, ideas which
commonly go together and have played an immense part in the life
of some peoples, notably in Japan; they have served as effective
national bonds in periods of transition through which despotically
ruled populations have progressed to true nationhood. The idea of
the divine right of kings played for a time a similar r&ocirc;le in
Europe.</p>

<p>A good example of the operation of an ideal in a modern nation
is that of the ideal of a great colonial empire in the French nation.
No doubt, hopes of economic advantages may have played some
part in this case; but the growth of the immense oversea empire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of modern France, as well as of the great extra-European conquests
which France has made in the past but has ceased to control,
seems to have been due in the main to the operation of this ideal in
the national mind. France has no surplus population, and no
Frenchman desires to leave his beautiful France; everyone regards
himself as cruelly exiled if compelled to live for a time in
any of the oversea possessions; and most of these, notably the
Indo-Chinese Empire are very expensive, costing the nation far
more in administrative expenses than any profits derived from them,
and involving constant risks of international complications and war,
as in Morocco in recent years. Nevertheless, the ideal still holds
sway and, under its driving power, the oversea territories of France,
especially in Africa, have grown enormously. And this ideal has
inevitably incorporated itself in the organisation of the nation, in
a colonial office and a foreign legion, and all the administrative
machinery necessarily set up for securing the ends prescribed by
the ideal.</p>

<p>In modern times the most striking illustration of the power of
ideas on national life is afforded by the influence of the ideals of
liberty and equality. It was the effective teaching of these ideals of
liberty and equality, primarily by Rousseau, to a people prepared
by circumstances to receive them, which produced the French Revolution;
and all through the nineteenth century they have continued
to determine great changes of political and social organisation in
many countries of Europe and in America.</p>

<p>In England the idea of liberty has long been current and long
ago had become incorporated and expressed in the national organisation;
but its application received a vast extension when in 1834
England insisted on the liberation of all British-owned slaves and
paid twenty million sterling in compensation. That the idea still
lives on among us, with this extended application, seems to have
been proved by the results of recent elections which were influenced
largely by the force of the no-slavery cry in relation to coloured
labour. It is an excellent example of an established collective ideal
against which reason is of no avail.</p>

<p>The ideal of liberty never entered the minds of the most advanced
peoples of antiquity; their most enlightened political thinkers could
not imagine a State which was not founded upon slavery. Yet it has
become collectively accepted by all the leading nations, and the
ordinary man has so entirely accepted it that he cannot be brought
to reason about it. Facts and arguments tending to show that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
greater part of the population of the world might be happier
without liberty and under some form of slavery cannot touch or
enter his mind at all.</p>

<p>The ideal of political equality is of still later growth, and is in
a sense derivative from that of liberty; it was in the main accepted
as a means to liberty, but has become an end in itself. It is
moulding national organisation everywhere; through its influence
parliamentary government and universal suffrage are becoming the
almost universal rule, and, through leading to their adoption, this
ideal is in a fair way to wreck certain of the less firmly organised
nations, and possibly our own also.</p>

<p>But the ideal which, beyond all others, characterises the present
age of almost all the nations of the world is the ideal of progress.
Hardly anyone has any clear notion what he means by progress, or
could explicate the idea; but the sentiment is very strong, though
the idea is very vague. This idea also was unknown to the leading
thinkers of antiquity and is of recent growth; yet it is so almost
universally accepted, and it so permeates the mental atmosphere in
every direction, that it is hard for us to realise how new a thing in
the history of the world is the existence, and still more the effective
dominance, of the idea. It is perhaps in America that its rule is
most absolute; there the severest condemnation that can be passed
by the average man upon any people or institution is to say that
it is fifty years behind the time. The popular enthusiasm for flying-machines,
which threatens to make life almost unlivable, is one of
the striking illustrations of the force of this ideal.</p>

<p>More recent still, and perhaps equally important, is the idea of
the solidarity of the human race and of the responsibility of each
nation towards the rest, especially towards the weaker and more
backward peoples. We no longer cheerfully and openly exterminate
an inferior people; and, when we do so, it is with some expressions
of regret and even of indignation.</p>

<p>But this moral idea is still in process of finding acceptance and
illustrates well that process. It has been taught by a few superior
minds and none dares openly repudiate it; hence, it gains ground
and is now commonly accepted, verbally at least, and is just beginning
to affect national action.</p>

<p>The four ideas, liberty, equality, progress, and human solidarity
or universal responsibility, seem to be the leading ideas of the present
era, the ideas which, in conjunction with national sentiments, are
more than any other, fashioning the future of the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The last two illustrate exceptionally well the capacity of nations
to be moved by abstract ideas not directly related to the welfare
of the individuals whose actions they determine; they show once
more how false is the doctrine that national life is but the conflict
of individual wills striving after individual goods. They show that,
through his life in and mental interaction with organised society,
man is raised morally and intellectually high above the level he
could individually achieve.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h4>NATIONS OF THE HIGHER TYPE</h4>

<p>Let us consider now the type of nation which from our present point
of view is the most interesting, the type which approximates most
nearly to a solution of the problem of civilisation, to the reconciliation
of individuality with collectivity, to the synthesis of individualist
and collectivist ideals; that in which the rights and wills of individuals
are not forcibly subordinated to those of the State by the power of
a governing class, and in which the deliberative side of the national
mind is well developed and effective.</p>

<p>Such are in a certain degree the French, but still more the British
and the American nations. In the two latter countries the rights
of the individual are made supreme over all other considerations, the
welfare of the whole is only to be advanced by measures which do
not override individual wills and rights; or, at least, the only power
which is admitted to have the right in any degree to override individual
wills is the will of the majority. In such a nation the greatest
efforts are concentrated on the perfection of the deliberative organisation,
by means of which the general mind may arrive at collective
judgment and choice of means and may express its will. A vast amount
of time and energy is devoted to this deliberative work; while the
executive organisation, by which its decisions have to be carried
into effect, is apt to be comparatively neglected and hence imperfect.</p>

<p>These two complementary features of such states we see well
exemplified here and in America<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; where the amount of time, money,
and effort spent upon the deliberative processes and the elaboration
of the organisation through which they are effected is enormously
greater than in other nations. And, in spite of the energy expended
on deliberative processes and on the elaboration of their organisation,
the interests of the nation as a whole are not at present forwarded
in a manner at all comparable with those of such a State as Germany.
Nevertheless, such national actions as we do achieve are far more
truly the expression of the national will; and, if the national mind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
is to be developed to a high level, this vast expenditure of energy,
which to some impatient spirits seems wasteful and useless, must
go on.</p>

<p>As was said in a former chapter, such collective deliberation of
modern nations is only rendered possible by the great facilities of
communication we enjoy; telegraph, post, and railway, and especially
the press. The ancients saw truly enough that, with their limited
means of communication, the higher form of state-organisation must
be restricted to a small population of some thousands only&mdash;the
City-State.</p>

<p>It is important to note that not only do modern facilities of
communication render possible a truly collective mental life for the
large Nation-States of the present age; but that these modern conditions
actually carry with them certain great advantages, which
tend to raise the collective mental life of modern nations to a higher
level than was possible for the ancient City-State, even though its
members were of high average capacity and many of them of very
great mental power, as in Athens.</p>

<p>The assembly of citizens in one place for national deliberation
rendered them much more susceptible to those less desirable peculiarities
of collective mental life which characterise simple crowds;
particularly, the excess of emotional excitement, increased suggestibility,
and, hence, the ease with which the whole mass could be swayed
unduly by the skilful orator. In the modern nation, on the other
hand, the transmission of news by the press secures a certain delay,
and a lack of synchronism, in its reception by different groups and
individuals; and it secures also a certain delay in the action and
reaction of mind on mind, which gives opportunity for individual
deliberation. Also the sympathetic action of the mass mind on the
individual mind is in large part indirect, rather than direct, representative
rather than perceptual, and therefore less overwhelming
in its effects. These conditions greatly temper the violence of
the emotional reactions and permit of a diversity of feeling
and opinion; an opposed minority has time to form itself and
to express an opinion, and so may temper the hasty and emotional
reaction of the majority in a way that is impossible in a general
assembly.</p>

<p>A further advantage of the large size of nations may arise
from the fact that actual decision as to choice of means for effecting
national action has to be achieved by means of representatives who
come together in one place. Representative government is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
merely an inferior substitute for government by general assembly;
it is superior in many respects. If each representative were a mere
delegate, an average specimen of the group he represents, chosen
by lot and merely charged to express their will, this feature would
modify the crude collective mental processes in one important
respect only; namely, it would counteract to some extent that
weakening of individual responsibility which is characteristic of
collective mental action. But, in addition to this, internal organisation,
in the form of tradition and custom, comes in to modify very
greatly the collective process.</p>

<p>We see such modifying influence very clearly in the election of
the English House of Commons and in the methods of its operations.
Owing partly to a natural tendency, partly to a fortunate tradition,
the people do not elect just any one of themselves to serve as a
delegate or average sample of the mass; but as a rule they choose,
or try to choose, some man who displays special capacity and special
qualifications for taking part in the national deliberations. In so
far as they are successful in this, their representatives are able men
and men to whose minds the social consciousness, the consciousness
of the whole people, of its needs and tendencies and aspirations, is
more fully and clearly present than to the average mind. They are
also in the main men of more than average public spirit. Hence it
is not unknown that a purely working class constituency, being
offered liberal, conservative, and labour candidates, instead of
choosing the labour man, one of themselves, gives him only a small
fraction of the total votes. Then, within the body of representatives,
this process, by which greater influence is given to the abler men,
to those whose minds reflect most fully the whole people, is carried
further still. A small group of these men exerts a predominant
influence in all deliberations; and not only are they in the main
the best qualified (for they only attain their leading positions by
success in an intense and long continued competition) but they
are put in a position in which they can hardly fail to feel a great
responsibility resting upon them; and in which they feel the full
force of political traditions. The deliberative organisation of the
American nation illustrates, when compared with our own, the
importance of these traditions; for its lesser efficiency is largely due
to the absence of such traditions, and to the fact that their system
banishes from the House of Representatives its natural leaders and
those on whom responsibility falls most heavily.</p>

<p>Lastly, the existence of two traditionally opposed parties ensures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
that every important step shall be fully discussed. The traditional
division into two parties, which from one point of view seems so
irrational, nevertheless exerts very important and valuable influences,
of which the chief is that it prevents the assembly of legislators
becoming a mere psychological crowd easily swayed to a decision
by collective emotion and skilful suggestion; for each suggestion
coming from the one party acts by contra-suggestion upon the other
and provokes an opposition that necessitates discussion<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.</p>

<p>In these two ways, then;&mdash;first, through the culmination of
national deliberation among a selected group of representatives,
among whom again custom and tradition accord precedence and
prestige to the natural leaders, the most able and those in whose
consciousness the nation, in the past, present and future is most
adequately reflected; secondly, by means of the party system,
which ensures vigorous criticism and full discussion of all proposals,
under a system of traditional conventions evolved for the regulation
of such discussions;&mdash;in these two ways the principal vices of collective
deliberation are corrected, and the formal deliberations and decisions
of the nation are raised to a higher plane than the collective
deliberations of any assembly of men lacking such traditional organisation
could possibly attain. The part played by unwritten tradition
in the working of the British constitution is of course immense, as
for example, the existence and enormous prestige of the cabinet,
and the tradition that a party coming into power must respect the
legislation of the party previously in power. Without this last,
representative government, or at any rate the party system, would
be impossible. The smooth working of the system depends entirely
upon the influence of these and similar traditions which exist only
in the minds of men. Or, take as another example, the tradition of
absolute impartiality on the part of the Speaker and of loyal acceptance
of his rulings by every member of the House; or the tradition
which distinguishes sharply between political and private relations,
in virtue of which the parties to a most bitter political strife may and
very generally do remain in perfectly friendly private relations.</p>

<p>These and other such traditions, which secure the efficient working
of the organisation for national deliberation, all rest in turn upon a
traditional and tacit assumption&mdash;namely, the assumption that both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
parties are working for the good of the nation as they conceive and
understand it, that both parties have this common end and differ only
in their judgment as to the means by which it can best be achieved.
They rest also on the traditional and tacit admission that one&#8217;s
own judgment, and that of one&#8217;s party, may be mistaken, and that
in the long run the legislation which any party can effect is an
expression of the organised national mind and is therefore to be
respected. It is this acquiescence in accomplished legislation in
virtue of this tacit assumption which gives to the decisions of
Parliament the status, not merely of the expression of the will of a
bare majority, but of the expression of the will of practically the
whole nation. Underlying the stability of the whole system, again,
is the tradition, sedulously fostered and observed by the best and
leading minds, that the <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> and purpose of the representative
parliament is to organise, and to give the most complete possible
expression to, the national mind and will; and that no constitutional
change or change of procedure is justifiable unless it tends to the
more complete realisation of these objects.</p>

<p>In virtue of these traditions our Parliament and Press constitute
undoubtedly the best means for effecting organisation of the national
mind in its deliberative aspect that has yet been evolved; and we
should remember this when we feel inclined to gird at the &#8216;great
talking shop,&#8217; at the slowness of its procedure and at the logical
absurdities of the two-party system; and, above all, we should realize
how valuable and worthy of conservation are these scarcely formulated
traditions, for they are absolutely essential to its efficiency. It
is just because the efficiency of the deliberative organisation of a
nation depends upon the force of such traditions, that, though it is
possible to take the system of parliamentary representation and
establish it by decree or plebiscite in a nation which has hitherto
had no such deliberative organisation, it is not possible to make it
work smoothly and efficiently amongst such a people. Hence, although
almost every civilised nation has done its best to imitate the British
system of parliamentary government, hardly any one has made a
success of it; and, in nearly all, it is in constant danger of being
superseded by some more primitive form of government&mdash;one need
only mention Mexico, Portugal, Russia, France, Austria-Hungary.
In all these countries, and even in America, there seems to be
already a not very remote possibility of the supersession of parliamentary
government by a dictatorship&mdash;a process which has actually
occurred in many of the municipal governments of America, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
fear of which has constantly checked the smooth working of the
parliamentary system in France.</p>

<p>As a single illustration of the way in which the conditions we
have been considering affect the collective acts of the nation, consider
what happened at the time of the Russian outrage in the North
Sea during the Russo-Japanese war. When a Russian fleet fired upon
our fishing boats doing considerable damage to them, the means of
communication were sufficiently developed among us to allow of the
action and reaction of all on each which produces the characteristic
results of collective mental action, the exaltation of emotion, the
suggestibility, the sense of irresponsible power; and, in the absence
of the deliberative organisation which, by concentrating influence
and responsibility in the hands of a few of the best men, controlled
and modified this collective action, we should have rushed upon the
Russian fleet and probably have brought on a general European
war. The control and counteraction of this kind of outburst of collective
emotion and impulsive action is one of the heaviest responsibilities
of those to whom predominant influence is accorded.</p>

<p>It is only in virtue of the strong organisation of the national
mind resting upon these long traditions of parliamentary government,
that at such a time control of the popular emotion and impulse is
possible. And the weaker and less efficient is such traditional
organisation, the more does any such incident tend to provoke a
collective manifestation which approximates in its uncontrollable
violence and unconsidered impulsiveness to the behaviour of an
unorganised crowd. Hence governments, where the democratic
principle is acknowledged but the traditional organisation is less
strong, are constantly in danger of having their hands forced by
some outburst of popular passion&mdash;as in France.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that, when Aristotle inveighed against democracy
as an evil form of government, the only form of democratic government
he had in mind was government by the voices of a mob gathered
together in one place and lacking all the safeguards which, as we
have seen, render our British national deliberations so much superior
to those of a mere crowd of persons of equally good average capacity
and character.</p>

<p>But it is not only in the formal deliberations of the nation that
internal organisation, resting on tradition, secures the predominance
of the influence of the best and ablest minds. The same is true of
all national thought and feeling. There exists in every great nation
the vague influence we call public opinion, which is the great upholder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of right and justice, which rewards virtue and condemns
vice and selfishness. Public opinion exists only in the minds of
individuals (for we have rejected, provisionally at least, the conception
of a collective consciousness); yet it is a product not of
individual, but of collective, mental life. And it has in any healthy
nation far higher standards of right and justice and tolerance than
the majority of individuals could form or maintain; that is to say,
it is in these respects far superior to an opinion which would be the
mere resultant or algebraic sum of the opinions of all the living
individuals. In reference to any particular matter its judgment is
far superior to that of the average of individuals, and superior
probably in many cases to that which even the best individuals
could form for themselves.</p>

<p>How does public opinion come to be superior to individual and
to average opinion? There seems to be something paradoxical in
the statement.</p>

<p>The fact is of the utmost importance; for public opinion is
the ultimate source of sanctions of all public acts, the highest court
of appeal before which every executive act performed in the name
of the nation must justify itself. If public opinion were merely
the immediate expression of the collective feelings and judgments
of an unorganised mass of men, its verdicts would be (as we have
seen) inferior to those of the average individuals, whereas, as a
matter of fact, its expressions are much superior to those of the
average individuals.</p>

<p>The influence of public opinion is especially clear and interesting
in its relations to law. In this country it is not made by law, but
makes law. Where law is imposed and long maintained by the
authority of despotic power, it will of course mould public opinion;
but, in any progressive highly organised nation, law and the lawyers
are always one or two or more generations behind public opinion.
The most progressive body of law formally embodies the public
opinion of past generations rather than of the generation living at
the time.</p>

<p>The fact of the superiority of public opinion is generally admitted
and various explanations are current, for the most part very
vague and incomplete. There is the mystical explanation embodied
in the dictum that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
A rather less vague explanation is that adopted by Mr Beattie
Crozier<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> (among others). It is said that the average man carries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
within him a germ of an ideal of justice and right, and that he
applies this to the criticism or approval of the actions of other men;
though he often fails to apply it to his own actions, because, where
his own interests are concerned, he is apt to be the sport of purely
egoistic impulses.</p>

<p>But this explanation is only partially true. It represents the
average man as more hypocritical than he really is, and as falling
farther below the standards he acknowledges than he actually does
fall. It leaves unexplained the fact that he has this sentiment
for an ideal of justice and right; and it proceeds on a false
assumption as to the nature of the problem, in assuming that
men judge the actions of other men by higher standards than
those which they apply to their own conduct; whereas this is by
no means generally true.</p>

<p>Is it, then, that superior abilities, which enable a man to gain
prestige and to impress his ideas and sentiments upon his fellow men
and so to influence public opinion, are commonly combined with
a natural superiority of moral sentiment, with a love of right and
a hatred of injustice? There may be some degree of such natural
correlation of superior abilities with superior moral qualities, but
the supposition seems very doubtful; and certainly, if it exists, it
is not sufficient to account for the elevation of public opinion.
We frequently see consummate ability combined with most questionable
moral sentiments, as in Napoleon and many other historic
personages.</p>

<p>The true explanation is, I submit, to be found in the basal fact
that the moral sentiments are essentially altruistic, while the immoral
and non-moral sentiments are in the main self-regarding<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.
Hence, the person who has great abilities but is lacking in moral
sentiments and altruism applies his abilities to secure his personal
satisfactions and aggrandisement; and, in so far as he aims at affecting
the minds of others, he tries only to secure their obedience to his
commands and suggestions, to inspire them with deference, admiration,
fear and awe, and to evoke an outward display of these
feelings. But, as to the ideas and sentiments of the people in general,
save in so far as they affect his own gratification, he cares nothing.
Accordingly we never find great abilities deliberately, consistently
and directly applied to the degradation of public opinion and morals,
save occasionally in relation to some particular end. And we find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
few or no great works of literature and art deliberately aiming at
such degradation.</p>

<p>But with those persons in whom great abilities are naturally
combined with moral disposition the case is very different. The
moral disposition is essentially altruistic; it is concerned for the
welfare of others, of men in general. Hence such a man deliberately
applies his abilities to influence the minds of others. The
exertion of such influence is for him an end in itself. He seeks and
finds his chief satisfaction in exerting an influence, as wide and deep
as possible, over the minds of men; not merely in evoking fear or
admiration of himself, but in inspiring in them the same elevated
sentiments and sympathies which he finds within himself.</p>

<p>For this reason such men as G. F. Watts, Carlyle and Ruskin exert
a much greater and more widespread and lasting influence over the
minds of men than do equally able men who are devoid of moral
disposition; for the former make the exertion of this influence their
chief end, while the others care not at all about the state of public
opinion and the minds of the mass. Still less does the non-moral
man of great ability strive with all his powers to make others act
upon base motives like his own and to degrade their sentiments;
rather, he sees that he can better accomplish his selfish ends if other
men are unlike himself and are governed by altruistic sentiments;
and he sees also that he can better attain his ends if he does lip-service
to altruistic ideals; and he is, therefore, apt to exert whatever
direct influence he has over the sentiments of men in the same
direction as the moral leaders, praising the same actions, upholding
in words the same ideals. In this way the men of great abilities,
but of immoral or non-moral character, actually aid the moral leaders
to some extent in their work; whereas under no conditions is the
relation reversed; the moral leaders never praise or acquiesce in
bad actions, but always denounce them and use their influence
against them.</p>

<p>It follows that, in a well organised nation, public opinion, which
is formed and maintained so largely by the influence of leading
personalities, will usually be more in conformity with the sentiments
of the best men than of the average man, will be above rather than
below private opinion. For, if the bad and the good men of exceptional
powers were equal in numbers and capacity, the sum of their
influences tending directly to exalt public opinion would be enormously
greater than the sum of their influences tending to degrade
it; and, as a matter of fact, the influence for good of a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
altruistic leaders is able to outweigh the degrading influences of a
much larger number of purely selfish men of equally great capacities,
and is able to maintain a high standard of public opinion.</p>

<p>We have distinguished a formal and an informal organisation of
the national deliberative processes, the latter expressing itself as
public opinion. These two organisations co-exist and are, of course,
not altogether independent of one another; yet they may be to
a considerable extent independent; though the more intimate the
functional relations and the greater the harmony between them, the
healthier will be the national life.</p>

<p>We may note in passing an interesting difference in respect to
organisation of the national mind between the English and the
American peoples, a difference which illustrates this relative independence
of the formal and informal organisations.</p>

<p>In England both the formal and informal organisations have
achieved a pretty good level; in both cases the best minds are
enabled to exert and have long exerted a dominant influence; and
the interaction between the two organisations is very intimate. But
in America, while the informal organisation expressed in public
opinion seems to be very highly developed, the formal organisation
is much inferior; it has not yet such traditions as give the greatest
influence to the best minds and embody the effects of their influence.
And the better Americans tend to value lightly the formal organisation,
to take no part in the working of it, deliberately to ignore it,
and to rely rather upon public opinion to repress any evils when
they are in danger of reaching an intolerable development.</p>

<p>Both in the formal organisation of the national mind, which is
the parliamentary or other national assembly, and in the informal
organisation which is public opinion, we see, then, that (in the nation
of higher civilisation at least) organisation results in a raising of
the collective mental process above the level of the average minds,
because it gives a predominant influence to the best minds who form
and maintain the traditions, especially the moral traditions; and these
press upon the minds of all members of the community from their
earliest years, moulding them more or less into conformity with themselves,
fostering the better, repressing the purely egoistic, tendencies.</p>

<p>And the ideal organisation after which we ought to strive, is that
which would give the greatest possible influence of this sort to the
best minds, an influence which consists not in merely organising and
directing the energies of the people in the manner most effective
for material or even scientific progress, as in modern Germany; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
one which, by moulding the sentiments and guiding the reasoning
of the people in all matters, public and private alike, secures their
consent and agreement and the co-operation of their wills in all
affairs of national importance.</p>

<p>When such organisation is in any degree attained and a more
or less consistent system of national traditions is embodied in the
political, religious, literary, and scientific culture, which moulds in
some degree the minds of all men, the national mind clearly becomes,
as we said in an earlier chapter, a system of interacting mental forces
which are not merely tendencies of the living members of the nation,
but are also, in an even greater degree, the ideas and tendencies of
the dead; and we see also that in such a people the national consciousness
is most truly embodied, not in the minds of the average
men, but in the minds of the best men of the time.</p>

<p>The term &#8216;public opinion&#8217; is sometimes, perhaps generally, used
in a looser and wider sense than the meaning implied in the foregoing
pages. It is used in the looser sense by President Lowell in his
<i>Public Opinion and Popular Government</i>. By &#8216;public opinion&#8217; he
seems to mean simply the algebraic sum or balance of individual
opinions; he writes &#8220;the opinion of the whole people is only the
collected opinions of all the persons therein<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.&#8221; In accordance with
this view, he regards representative institutions as merely one means
by which this sum of opinions may be collected and recorded. And
he seems to be prepared to regard the &#8216;referendum&#8217; or the &#8216;initiative&#8217;
in any of their forms, or other methods of direct legislation, as
equally good methods, if only all individuals would take the trouble
to register their votes upon every question proposed to them. He is
aware, of course, that this can hardly be expected of persons who have
other interests and occupations than the purely political, and that
the direct methods are therefore impracticable as general methods
of legislation. If it were true that representative institutions do and
should merely collect and record the individual opinions of all
members of the public, then it is obvious that each representative
should be merely a delegate sent to record the votes of the majority
of his constituents. Whereas, if representative institutions should,
and in various degrees do, constitute the formal deliberative organisation
of the national mind, through which national deliberation and
judgment are raised to a higher plane than that of a mere crowd,
it follows that the representative should exert his own powers
of reasoning and judgment, aided by his special knowledge and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
equipment, by the special sources of information that he enjoys,
in the light of the discussions in which he takes part, and influenced
by all those political traditions whose force he experiences in exceptional
fulness by reason of his priviledged position. President Lowell,
in discussing the functions of the representative, does not decide in
favour of the former view, as consistency should perhaps lead him
to do; thereby showing that he is not wholly committed to the
individualist view. He discusses the question whether the member
of Parliament or Congress should regard himself as representing the
interests of his constituents alone, or as concerned primarily and
chiefly with the interests of the whole people; and he rightly inclines
to the latter view. This is not quite the same distinction as that
which is insisted upon in these pages. Even if each representative
were concerned only for the welfare of the nation as a whole, yet
so long as he regarded it as his sole function to vote as he believes
the majority of the citizens would vote in any process of direct
legislation, he would fall short of the highest duty which is laid
upon him by his position&mdash;namely, not merely that of recording the
opinion of the majority, but that of taking part in the organised
deliberative activities of the national mind by which it arrives at
judgments and decisions of a higher order than any purely individual,
or algebraic sum of individual, judgments and decisions<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>Public opinion, in the sense in which I have used the words in
this chapter (which seems to me the only proper use of them) is,
then, not a mere sum of individual opinions upon any particular
question; it is rather the expression of that tone or attitude of mind
which prevails throughout the nation and owes its quality far more
to the influence of the dead than of the living, being the expression
of the moral sentiments that are firmly and traditionally established
in the mind of the people, and established more effectively and in
more refined forms in the minds of the leaders of public opinion than
in the average citizen. This tone of the national mind enables it to
arrive at just judgments on questions of right and wrong, of duty
and honour and public desert; though it may have little bearing
upon such practical questions as bimetallism, tariff reform, or railway
legislation. The current use of the term, in this country at least, does,
I think, recognise that public opinion properly applies only to the
sphere of moral judgments and can and should have no bearing upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the practical details of legislation. Public opinion is, both in its
development and in its operations, essentially collective; it is
essentially the work of the group mind. Its accepted standards of
value are slowly built up under the influence of the moral leaders
of past ages; and, in the application of those standards to any particular
question, the influence of the moral leaders of the time makes
itself felt. I have kept in mind in the foregoing pages the public
opinion of the nation; but every community, every association,
every enduring group has its own public opinion, which, though it
is influenced by, and indeed is, as it were, a branch of, the main stem
of national public opinion and is therefore of the same fibre and
texture, has nevertheless its own peculiar tone and quality, especially
in regard to the moral questions with which each group is specially
concerned.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III"></a>PART III</h2>

<h4>THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL MIND
AND CHARACTER</h4>
<hr />

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<p>In the first Part of this book we have reviewed the most general
principles of collective mental life, beginning with the unorganised
crowd as affording the simplest example, considering then an army
as the simplest example of the profound modifications of collective
mental life effected by organisation of the group. In the second
Part we passed on to apply these principles to the understanding of
the mind of the nation as the most important, complex, and interesting
of all types of the group mind.</p>

<p>In the third Part I take up the consideration in a general
way of the processes by which national mind and character are
gradually built up and shaped in the long course of ages. For, just
as we cannot understand individual minds, their peculiarities and
differences, without studying their development, so we cannot hope
to understand national mind and character and the peculiarities and
differences of nations, without studying the slow processes through
which they have been built up in the course of centuries.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter, in connexion with the question of the
importance of homogeneity of mental qualities as a condition of the
existence of the national mind, I argued that race has really considerable
influence in moulding the type of national mind. I recognized
that differences of innate qualities between races, at any rate between
allied subraces, are not great, and that they can be, and
generally are, almost completely over-ridden and obscured in each
individual by the moulding power of the social environment in which
he grows up; but I urged that these racial qualities are very persistent,
and that they exert a slight but constant pressure or bias upon the
development of all that constitutes social environment, upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
forms of institutions, customs, traditions, and beliefs of every kind,
so that the effect of such slight but constant bias accumulates from
generation to generation, and in the long run exerts an immense
influence.</p>

<p>One way of treating the part played by the racial mental qualities
in the development of the national mind would be to attempt to
define the racial or innate peculiarities of the peoples existing at
the present time, and to assume that these peculiarities were produced
in the remote past, before the formation of nations began,
and that they have persisted unchanged throughout the period of
the development of nations. Something of this sort was proposed
by Walter Bagehot in his <i>Physics and Politics</i>. He distinguished in
the development of peoples two great periods&mdash;on the one hand the
race-making period, which roughly corresponds to the whole prehistoric
period, and on the other hand the nation-making period,
which roughly corresponds to the historic period. This distinction
has undoubtedly a certain validity.</p>

<p>It seems probable that man was evolved from his prehuman
ancestry as a single stock, probably a stock somewhat widely distributed
in the heart of the Eurasian continent, or possibly in Africa
according to the recent view of some authors, or in the area which
is now the Indian Ocean. If this be true, it follows that the
differentiation of the mental and physical qualities of the principal
human races, the differentiation of the white and black and yellow
and brown races, as well as of the chief subraces, such as the
Semitic, the races of Europe&mdash;the <i>Homo Europaeus</i>, <i>Alpinus</i> and
<i>Mediterraneus</i>&mdash;was the work of the immensely prolonged prehistoric
period. For these races and subraces, as we now know them, seem
to have been in existence and to have had recognisably and substantially
the same leading qualities, both mental and physical, that
they now have, before the beginning of the historic period.</p>

<p>The racial differentiation during the prehistoric period must
have been much greater than during the historic period; and this
was not only because the former period was immensely longer, but
also because, in all probability, the rate of racial change has been
on the whole slower in the historic period.</p>

<p>The differentiation of racial types in the prehistoric period must
have been in the main the work of differences of physical environment,
operating directly by way of selection, by way of the adaptation
of each race to its environment through the extermination of the
strains least suited to exist under those physical conditions. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
this process, this direct moulding of racial types by physical environment,
must have been well nigh arrested as soon as nations began
to form. For the formation of nations implies the beginning of
civilisation; and civilisation very largely consists in the capacity
of a people to subdue their physical environment, or at least to
adapt the physical environment to men&#8217;s needs to a degree
that renders them far less the sport of it than was primitive man;
it consists, in short, in replacing man&#8217;s natural environment by an
artificial environment largely of his own choice and creation.</p>

<p>In a second and perhaps even more important way, the formation
of nations with the development of civilisation modified and weakened
the moulding influence of the physical environment; namely,
it introduced social co-operation in an ever increasing degree, so that
the perpetual struggle of individuals and of small family groups
with one another and with nature was replaced by a co-operative
struggle of large communities against the physical environment
and with one another. And in this process those members
of each community who, by reason of weakness, general incapacity,
or other peculiarity, would have been liable to be eliminated under
primitive conditions became shielded in an ever increasing degree
by the powers of the stronger and more capable against the selective
power of nature and against individual human forces. And, although
within the community the rivalry of individuals and families still
went on, it was no longer so much a direct struggle for existence, but
rather became more and more a struggle for position in the social
scale; and failure in the struggle no longer necessarily meant death,
or even incapacity to leave an average number of descendants. That
is to say, primitive man&#8217;s struggle for existence against the forces
of nature and against his fellow men, which made for racial evolution
and differentiation through survival of those fittest to cope with
various environments, tended to be replaced by a struggle which no
longer made for racial evolution towards a higher type, and which
may even have made for race-deterioration, at the same time that
civilisation and national organisation continued to progress.</p>

<p>We may, then, recognise a certain truth in Bagehot&#8217;s distinction
of two great periods, the race-making and the nation-making periods.
Nevertheless, it would not be satisfactory to follow the course suggested
above and simply assume certain racial characters as given
fixed data without further consideration. For, firstly, it is interesting
and perhaps not altogether unprofitable to indulge in speculations
on the race-making processes of the prehistoric period. Secondly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
although it seems likely that racial changes have been in the main
slower and on the whole relatively slight in the historic period, yet
they have not been altogether lacking; and, in proportion to their
magnitude, such changes as have occurred have been of great
importance for national life; and changes of this kind are still
playing their part in shaping the destinies of nations. Possible racial
changes of mental qualities must therefore be considered, when we
seek to give a general account of the conditions of the development
of nations.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must reject root and branch the crude
idea, which has a certain popular currency, that the development
of civilisation and of nations implies a parallel evolution of individual
minds. That idea we have already touched upon and rejected in a
previous chapter, where we arrived at the conclusion that there is
no reason to suppose the present civilised peoples to be on the
whole innately superior to their barbaric ancestors.</p>

<p>If we use the word &#8216;tradition&#8217; in the widest possible sense to denote
all the intellectual and moral gains of past generations, in so far as
they are not innate but are handed on from one generation to another
by the personal intercourse of the younger with the older generation,
and if we allow the notion of tradition to include all the institutions
and customs that are passed on from generation to generation, then
we may class all the changes of a people that constitute the evolution
of a national character under the two heads: <i>evolution of innate
qualities</i> and <i>evolution of traditions</i>. Using the word &#8216;tradition&#8217; in
the wide sense just now indicated, the traditions of a people may
be said to include the recognised social organisation of the whole
people into classes, castes, clans, phratries, or groups of any kind,
whose relations to one another and whose place in the national
system are determined by law, custom and conventions of various
kinds. This part of the total tradition is relatively independent of the
rest, and we may usefully distinguish the development of such
social organisation as social evolution&mdash;giving to the term this restricted
and definite meaning&mdash;and we may set it alongside the
other two conceptions as of co-ordinate value.</p>

<p>If we thus set apart for consideration under a distinct head the
evolution of social organisation, the rest of the body of national
traditions may be said to constitute the civilisation of a people.
For the civilisation of a people at any time is essentially the sum of
the moral and intellectual traditions that are living and operative
among them at that particular time. We are apt in a loose way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to consider the civilisation of a people to consist in its material
evidences; but it is only in so far as these material evidences, the
buildings, industries, arts, products, machinery, and so forth, are
the expression and outcome of its mental state that they are in any
degree a measure of its civilisation. We may realize this most
clearly by considering the case of a people on which the material
products of civilisation have been impressed from without. Thus
the peasants of India live amongst, and make use of, and benefit
materially by, the railways and irrigation works created by their
British rulers, and are protected from invasion and from internal
anarchy by the British military organisation and equipment; and
they play a subordinate though essential part in the creation and
maintenance of all these material evidences of civilisation. But
these material evidences are not the expression of the mental state
of the peoples of India, and form no true part of their civilisation;
and, in fact, they affect their civilisation astonishingly little; although
if these products of a higher civilisation should be maintained for
a long period of time they would, no doubt, produce changes of their
civilisation, probably tending in some degree to assimilate their
mental state to that of Western Europe.</p>

<p>We may, then, with advantage distinguish between the social
organisation and the civilisation of a people. In doing so we are of
course making an effort of abstraction, which, though it results in
an artificial separation of things intimately related, is nevertheless
useful and therefore justifiable. In a similar way the progress of civilisation
may be distinguished from social evolution. Social evolution
is profoundly affected by the progress of civilisation, and in turn
reacts powerfully upon it; for any given social organisation may
greatly favour or obstruct the further progress of civilisation.
There could have been no considerable advance of civilisation without
the evolution of some social organisation; but that the two things
are distinct is clear, when we reflect that there may be a very complex
social organisation, implying a long course of social evolution, among
a people that has hardly the rudiments of civilisation. Extreme
instances of social organisation in the absence of civilisation are
afforded by some animal societies&mdash;for example, societies of ants,
bees, and wasps. Among peoples, the native tribes of Australia illustrate
the fact most forcibly. They are at the very bottom of the
scale of civilisation; yet it has been discovered that they have a
complex and well-defined social organisation, which can only
have been achieved by a long course of social evolution. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
people are divided into totem clans, which clans are grouped in
phratries, each individual being born, according to well recognised
rules, into a clan of which he remains a life-long member; and his
membership in the clan and phratry involves certain well-defined
rights and obligations, and well-defined relations to other persons,
especially as regards marriage; and these rights, obligations and
relations are recognised and rigidly maintained throughout immense
areas.</p>

<p>On the other hand, although no people has attained any considerable
degree of civilisation without considerable social organisation,
nevertheless we can at least imagine a people continuing to
enjoy a high civilisation, practising and enjoying much of the arts,
sciences, philosophy, and literature, which we regard as the essentials
of civilisation, yet retaining a bare minimum of social organisation.
And this state of affairs is not only conceivable, but is held up as a
practicable ideal by philosophical anarchists such as Tolstoi and
Kropotkin; and it is, I think, true to say that the American nation
presents an approximation to this condition.</p>

<p>Again, a very high state of civilisation may co-exist with a
relatively primitive social organisation. Thus the civilisation of
Athens in the classical age was equal to, or even superior to, our own
in many respects; yet the social organisation was very much less
highly evolved. It had hardly emerged from the barbaric patriarchal
condition, and had at its foundation a cruel system of slavery<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>;
and it had also another great point of inferiority&mdash;namely, the very
restricted number of persons included in the social system. These
deficiencies, this rudimentary character, of its social organisation
was the principal cause of the instability and brief endurance of that
brilliant civilisation.</p>

<p>We have so far distinguished three principal factors or groups
of factors in the evolution of national mind and character: (1) Evolution
of innate or racial qualities: (2) Development of civilisation:
(3) Social evolution, or the development of social organisation.</p>

<p>Now the first two of these we may with advantage divide under
two parallel heads, the heads of intellectual and moral development.
No doubt, the intellectual and the moral endowment of a people
continually react on each other; and many of the manifestations of
the national mind are jointly determined by the intelligence and the
morality of a people; especially perhaps is this true of their religion
and their art. Nevertheless, it is clear that we can distinguish pretty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
sharply between the intellectual and the moral traditions of a people;
and that these may vary independently of one another to a great
extent. A rich and full intellectual tradition may go with a moral
tradition of very low level, as in the Italian civilisation of the
renascence; and a very high moral tradition with a relative poverty
of the intellectual, as in the early days of the puritan settlements
of New England.</p>

<p>The same distinction between the intellectual and the moral level
is harder to draw in the case of the racial qualities of a people, but
it undoubtedly exists and is valid in principle, no matter how difficult
in practice to deal with.</p>

<p>We have, then, to distinguish five classes of factors, five heads
under which all the factors which determine the evolution of national
character may be distributed. They are</p>

</tr></table>


<p>Every nation that has advanced from a low level to a higher
level of national life has done so in virtue of development or progress
in one or more of these respects. And a principal part of our task,
in considering the evolution of national mind and character, is to
assign to each of these its due importance and its proper place in
the whole complex development.</p>

<p>The distinction between the racial and the traditional level of
a people is too often ignored; chiefly, perhaps, for the reason that
it has usually been assumed that whatever is traditional becomes
innate and racial through use. Since in recent years it has been
shown that this assumption is very questionable, a number of
authors have recognised the importance of the distinction as regards
the intellectual qualities of a people; but, as regards the moral
qualities, the distinction is still very generally overlooked.</p>

<p>The neglect of these distinctions between the innate and the
traditional has in great measure vitiated much of the keen dispute
that has been waged over the question whether the progress of
civilisation depends primarily on intellectual or on moral advance.
For example, T. H. Buckle and Benjamin Kidd agreed in recognising
clearly the distinction between the innate and the traditional intellectual
status of a people; and they agreed in maintaining that we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
have no reason to believe that in the historic period any people has
made any considerable advance in innate intellectual capacity;
and that any such advance, if there has been any, has not been a
principal factor in the progress of civilisation. But they differed
extremely in that Buckle maintained that the primary cause of
all progress of national life is the improvement of its intellectual
tradition, that is, increase in the quantity and the worth of its stock
of knowledge and accepted beliefs, and improvements in methods of
intellectual operation; and he held that improvements of morals and
of social organisation have been secondary results of these intellectual
gains. Kidd, on the other hand<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, maintained that the progress of
European civilisation has been primarily due to an improvement of
the morality of peoples; that this has led to improvement of social
organisation; and that this in turn has been the essential condition
of the progress of the intellectual tradition, because it has secured
a stable social environment, a security of life, a free field for the
exercise of intellectual powers; in the absence of which conditions
the intellectual powers of a nation cannot effectively organise
themselves and apply themselves to the understanding of man and
nature, or to securing the traditional perpetuation of the gains which
they may sporadically achieve. We have to examine these views
and try to determine what truth they contain, and to show that they
are not wholly opposed but can in some measure be combined.</p>

<p>I propose to make first a very brief critical survey of some of
the most notable attempts that have been made to account for racial
qualities, and I shall try to supplement and harmonise these as far as
possible. We may with advantage consider at the outset the race-making
period, and afterwards go on to consider changes of racial
qualities in the historic period. This Part of the book is necessarily
somewhat speculative, but its interest and importance for our main
topic may justify its inclusion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h4>THE RACE-MAKING PERIOD</h4>

<p>Let us now see what can be said about the process of racial differentiation
which, as we saw in the foregoing chapter, was in its main
features accomplished in the prehistoric or race-making period. We
cannot hope to reach many positive conclusions, but rather merely
to discuss certain possibilities and probabilities in regard to the
main factors of the differentiation of racial mental types.</p>

<p>I would point out at once that the answer to be given to the
question&mdash;Are acquired qualities transmitted? Are the effects of
use inherited? is all important for our topic. I do not propose to
discuss that difficult question now. I will merely say that the present
state of biological science makes it seem doubtful whether such
inheritance takes place, and that, although the question remains
open, we are not justified in assuming an affirmative answer; that,
therefore, we must not be satisfied with any explanation of racial
and national characteristics based upon this assumption; and in the
following discussion I shall provisionally assume the truth of the
Neo-Darwinian principle that acquired modifications are not transmitted.</p>

<p>Assuming, as we must, that all peoples are descended from some
one original stock, the problem is&mdash;Can anything be said of the
conditions which have determined the differentiation of races of
different mental constitutions, of the development of racial qualities
which, having become relatively fixed, have led to the evolution of
different types of national organisation and culture? And especially
we have to consider the conditions which have produced, and may
still produce in the future, the qualities that make for the progress
of nations.</p>

<p>We must suppose a certain social organisation to have obtained
among that primitive human stock from which all races have been
evolved, probably an organisation in small groups based on the
family under the rule and leadership of a patriarch.</p>

<p>It is possible that considerable divergences of social organisation
may have taken place, without any advance towards civilisation;
such divergences of social organisation must have tended to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
divert the course of mental evolution along various lines; but they
must themselves have had their causes; they cannot in themselves
be the ultimate causes of divergence of racial mental types.</p>

<p>Such ultimate causes of the differentiation of mental qualities
must have been of two orders only, so far as I can see: (1) differences
of physical environment; (2) spontaneous variations in different
directions of the innate mental qualities of individuals, especially of
the more gifted and energetic individuals of each people.</p>

<p>In the mental evolution of animals these two factors are not
distinguishable. We may say that the main and perhaps the sole
condition of their evolution is the selection by the physical environment
of spontaneous favourable variations and mutations of innate
mental qualities; if we include under the term physical environment
of the species all the other animal and vegetable species of
its habitat. For it is only by its selective influence upon individual
variations that physical environment can determine differentiation
of races.</p>

<p>But with man the case is different; spontaneous variation not
only provides the new qualities which, by determining the survival
of the individual in his struggle for existence with the physical
environment, secure their own perpetuation by transmission to the
after coming generations. The new qualities determine mental evolution
in another manner, by a mode of operation which is almost
completely absent in animal evolution; namely, the spontaneous
variations create a social environment which profoundly modifies
the influence of the physical environment, and itself becomes a
principal factor in the determination of the trend of racial evolution.</p>

<p>Man is distinguished from the animals above all things by his
power of learning. Whereas the behaviour of animals, even of the
higher ones, consists almost entirely of purely instinctive actions,
innate modes of response to a limited number of situations; man
has an indefinitely great capacity for acquiring new modes of
response, and so of adapting himself in new and more complex ways
to an almost indefinite variety of situations. And his new mental
acquisitions are not made only by the slow process of adaptation
in the light of his own individual experience of the consequences of
behaviour of this and that kind; as are most of the few acquisitions
of the animals. By far the greater part of the mental stock-in-trade
by which his behaviour is guided is acquired from his fellow men;
it represents the accumulated experience of all the foregoing
generations of his race and nation. Man&#8217;s life in society, together
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
with the great plasticity of his mind, its great capacity for new
adaptations, secures him this enormous advantage; the two things
are necessarily correlated. Without the plasticity of mind, his life
in society would benefit him relatively little. Many animals that
lead a social life in large herds or flocks are not superior, but rather
inferior, in mental power to animals that lead a more solitary life;
and indeed this seems to be generally true, as we see on comparing
generally the herbivorous gregarious animals with the solitary
carnivores that prey upon them. The social life of such animals,
rendering individual intelligence less necessary for protection and
escape from danger, tends actually against mental development.</p>

<p>On the other hand, man&#8217;s great plastic brain would be of comparatively
little use to him if he lived a solitary unsocial life. His great
brain is there to enable him to assimilate and make use of the
accumulated experience, the sum of knowledge and morality, which
is traditional in the society into which he is born a member; that is
to say, the development of social life, which depended so much upon
language and for the forwarding of which language came into
existence, must have gone hand in hand with the development of
the great brain, which enables full advantage to be secured from
social co-operation and which, especially, renders possible the
accumulation of knowledge, belief, and traditional sentiment.</p>

<p>Now this traditional stock of knowledge and morality has been
very slowly accumulated, bit by bit; and every bit, every least new
addition to it, has been a difficult acquisition, due in the first
instance to some spontaneous variation of some individual&#8217;s mental
structure from the ancestral type of mental structure. That is to
say, throughout the evolution of civilisation, progress of every
kind, increase of knowledge or improvement of morality, has been
due to the birth of more or less exceptional individuals, individuals
varying ever so slightly from the ancestral type and capable, owing
to this variation, of making some new and original adaptation of
action, or of perceiving some previously undiscovered relation
between things.</p>

<p>These new acquisitions, first made by individuals, are, if true or
useful, sooner or later imitated or accepted by the society of which
the original-minded individual is a member, and then, becoming
incorporated in the traditional stock of knowledge and morality,
are thereby placed at the service of all members of that society.</p>

<p>Thus favourable spontaneous variations do not, as with the
animals, render possible mental evolution merely by conducing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the survival of, and the perpetuation of the qualities of, those
individuals in whom the variations occur. They may do this, or
they may not; but, in addition and more importantly, they contribute
to the stock of traditional knowledge and morality, and so
raise the social group as a whole in the scale of civilisation; they
render it more capable of successfully contending against other
groups and against the adverse influence of the physical environment;
and they promote the solidarity of the group by adding to
its stock of common tradition; thus the acquisitions of each member
benefit the group as a whole and all its members, quite apart from
any philanthropic purpose or intention of producing such a result.</p>

<p>The achievement of this unconscious undesigned solidarity of
human societies is one of two great steps in the evolution of the human
race by which the process is rendered very different from, and is
raised to a higher plane than, the mental evolution of the animal
world. The second and still more important step is one which is only
just beginning to be achieved in the present age; I shall have to touch
on it in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The original or primary divergence of mental type between any
two peoples must, then, have been due to these fundamental causes&mdash;namely,
differences of physical environment and spontaneous variations
of mental structure, the latter adding to the traditional stock
of knowledge and belief, of moral precepts and sentiments.</p>

<p>Intellectual or moral divergence produced by these two primary
causes would tend to determine the course of social evolution along
different lines and so to produce different types of social organisation.
And different social organisations thus produced would then react
upon the moral and intellectual life of the people to produce further
divergence; for example, one type of social organisation determined
by physical environment, say a well developed patriarchal system,
may have made for progress of intellect and morals; another, say
a matriarchal organisation, or one based on communal marriage,
may have tended to produce stagnation.</p>

<p>As social evolution proceeded and brought about more extensive
and more complex forms of social organisation, which included, within
any one society or group, larger numbers of individuals in more
effective forms of association, social organisation must have assumed
a constantly increasing importance as a condition of mental evolution
relatively to all other factors, especially as compared with the
influence of physical environment; until, in the complex societies
of the present time, it has an altogether predominant importance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
This truth is concisely stated in the old dictum that &#8220;in the infancy
of nations men shape the State; in their maturity the State shapes the
men.&#8221; Accordingly, in considering the mental evolution of peoples
we must never lose sight of the influence of social organisation.
It follows that the conditions of the mental evolution of man are immensely
more complex than those of the mental evolution of animals.</p>

<p>We must recognise not only the selection, through survival in
the struggle for existence, of new mental qualities arising as spontaneous
variations of individual mental structure. This, which is
the only, or almost the only, process at work in the mental evolution
of animals, is immensely complicated and overshadowed in importance
by two processes. The first is the accumulation of knowledge
and morality in traditional forms. The traditional accumulation,
which so far outweighs the mental equipment possible to any individual
isolated from an old society, not only constitutes in itself a
most important evolutionary product, but it modifies profoundly
the conditions of evolution of the individual innate qualities of mind;
for example, the greater and more valuable the stock of traditional
knowledge and morality becomes, the more does fitness to survive
consist in the capacity to assimilate this knowledge and to conform
to these higher moral precepts, the less does it consist in the purely
individualistic qualities, such as quickness of eye and ear, fleetness
of foot, or strength and skill of hand. Secondly, the processes of
natural selection are complicated by the social evolution, which
tends progressively to abolish the struggle for existence between
individuals, and to replace it by a struggle between groups; in which
struggle success is determined not only by the qualities of individuals,
but also very largely by the social organisation and by the traditional
knowledge and morality of the groups.</p>

<p>Each variety of the human species, each race considered as a
succession of individuals having certain innate mental qualities, has
been evolved, then, not merely under the influence of the physical
environment, like the animal species, but also and to an ever increasing
extent under the influence of the social environment. The
social environment we regard as consisting of two parts; namely,
the social organisation and the body of social tradition; for these,
though interdependent and constantly interacting, may yet with
advantage be kept apart in thought. We must, then, bear constantly
in mind the fact that man creates for himself an environment
which becomes ever more complex and influential, overshadowing
more and more in importance the physical environment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Here I would revert to some points of the analogy, drawn in
Chapter X, between the mind of a nation and that of an individual.
The mind of an individual human being develops by accumulating
the results of his experience; and so does that of a people. In
this respect the analogy holds good. But the development possible
to an individual is strictly limited in two ways. First, by the short
duration of the material basis of his mental life; secondly by the
extent of his innate capacities. Neither of these limitations applies
to the national mind. Its material basis is in principle immortal,
because its individual components may be incessantly renewed; and
its development has no limit set to it by its innate capacities, because
these may be indefinitely extended and improved. In these respects
the national mind resembles the species rather than the individual.</p>

<p>The development of the national mind, and of the minds of those
who share in the mental life of the nation, thus combines the
methods and advantages of the development of individuals and of
species, methods which are essentially different. The result is that
the mental development of man, since his social life began, has been
radically different from that of the animals; it has been a social process;
it has been the evolution of peoples rather than of individuals.
The evolution of man as an individual has been wholly subordinated
to that of peoples; and it is incapable of being understood or profitably
considered apart from the development of the group mind.</p>

<p>Assuming, as we must, that all the races of men are derived from
a common stock, it is obvious, I think, that the first differentiation of
racial types was determined almost exclusively by differences of
physical environment, and that the other conditions only very slowly
developed and did not assume their predominant importance until
the time which may be roughly defined as the beginning of the
historic or nation-making period.</p>

<p>Physical environment affects the mental qualities of a people
in three ways: firstly, it directly influences the minds of each
generation; secondly, it moulds the mental constitution by natural
selection, adapting the race to itself; thirdly, it exerts indirect
influence by determining the occupations and modes of life and,
through these, the social organisation of a people. We may consider
these three modes of influence in turn.</p>

<p>There has been much speculation on the direct influence of the
physical environment in moulding the mental type of a people, but
little or nothing can be said to be established.</p>

<p>There is a fair concensus of opinion to the effect that what we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
may call climate exerts an important influence. In climate the two
factors recognised as of chief importance are temperature and
moisture. High temperature combined with moisture certainly tends
to depress the vital activity of Europeans and to render them
indolent, indisposed to exertion of any kind. On the other hand,
high temperature combined with dryness of the atmosphere seems
to have the effect of rendering men but little disposed to continuous
activity, and yet capable of great efforts; it tends to produce a
violent spasmodic activity. A cold climate seems to dispose towards
sustained activity and, when combined with much moisture, to a
certain slowness.</p>

<p>These effects, which we ourselves experience and which we see
produced upon other individuals on passing from one climate to
another, we seem to see impressed upon many of the races which
have long been subjected to these climates; for example, the slow
and lazy Malays have long occupied the hottest moistest region of
the earth. The Arabs and the fiery Sikhs may be held to illustrate
the effect of dry heat. The Englishman and the Dutchman seem
to show the effects of a moist cool climate, a certain sluggishness
embodied with great energy and perseverance.</p>

<p>In these and other cases, in which the innate temperament of
a people corresponds to the effects directly induced by their climate,
it seems natural to suppose that the innate temperament has been
produced by the transmission and accumulation from generation
to generation of the direct effects of the climate. The assumption
is so natural that it has been made by almost every writer who has
dealt with the question. And these instances of conformity of the
temperament of peoples to the direct effects of climate are sometimes
offered as being among the most striking evidences of the reality
of hereditary transmission of acquired qualities; and the argument
is reinforced by instances of what seem to be similar results produced
by climate on physical types. Thus, it is said that in North
America a race characterised by a new specific combination of
mental and physical qualities is being rapidly formed; and it
seems to be well established that long slender hands are among
these features; for in Paris a specially long slender glove is made
every year in large quantities for the American market. Again, we
see apparently a change of physical type in the white inhabitants
of Australia. They seem to be becoming taller and more slender
&#8216;cornstalks&#8217;; and this is commonly regarded as the direct effect of
climate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, that a new race or subrace with a specific combination of
qualities should be forming in America is certainly to be expected
from the fact that the intimate blending of a number of European
stocks has been going on for some generations. But what gives
special support to the assumption that these new qualities are the
direct effects of climate is that these qualities, the physical at least,
seem to be approximations to the type of the Red Indians, the
aboriginal inhabitants. And, it is said, this approximation of type
can only be due to hereditary accumulation of the direct effects of
the climate on individuals.</p>

<p>Another way in which climate has been held to modify racial
mental qualities by direct action is through the senses, especially
the eye. M. Boutmy, in his book on the English people makes
great play with this principle<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. He points out that the thick hazy
state of the air, so common in our islands, renders vague and dull
all outlines and colours, so that the eye does not receive that wealth
of well-defined hues and forms which give so great a charm to some
more sunny lands, such as the Mediterranean coast lands. Hence,
he says, the senses become or remain relatively dull, and the sense-perceptions
slow and relatively indiscriminating. Such relative deficiency
of aesthetic variety and richness in the appearance of the
outer world produces secondarily a further and deeper modification
of mental type. In the lands where nature surrounds man with an
endless variety of rich and pleasing scenes, he can find sufficient
satisfaction in mere contemplation of the outer world; and, when he
takes to art production, he tends merely to reproduce in more or
less idealised forms the objects and scenes he finds around him; his
art tends to be essentially objective. On the other hand, in the dull
northern climes, man has not ever at hand these sources of satisfaction
in the mere contemplation of the outer world; consequently
he is driven back upon his own nature, to find his satisfactions in a
ceaseless activity of mind and body, but chiefly of the latter. Hence,
races so situated are characterised by great bodily activity and their
art and literature are essentially subjective. The thick air, the
monotony of vague form and colour, drive the mind to reflection
upon itself; and in art the objects of nature serve merely as symbols
by aid of which the mind seeks to express its own broodings. &#8220;The
painter paints with the intentions of the poet, the poet describes or
sings with the motives of the psychologist or moralist. All the
literature of imagination of the English shows us the internal reacting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
incessantly upon the external with a singular power of transfiguration
and interpretation<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.&#8221; Hence also poetry is the privilege of a few
rare spirits and is for them the product of deep reflection, not a
simple lyrical expression in which all can equally share.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that climate tends to produce these effects
by its direct action on individuals. Anyone who has lived for a time
in the southern climes must have noted these effects upon himself.
But we have no proof that the effects of climate are directly
inherited. It suffices to suppose that the direct effects are imposed
afresh by the climate on the minds of each generation. This view is
borne out by the fact that two races may live for many generations
in the same climate and yet remain very different in temperament
in these respects; for example the Irish climate is very similar to
the English, perhaps even more misty and damp; yet the Irish have
much more wit and liveliness than the English. And in every case
in which adaptation to physical environment has clearly become
innate or racial, an explanation can be suggested in terms of selection
of spontaneous variations, or of crossing of races. Thus, the approximation
of the American people to the type of the aboriginals, if it
is actual, and some observers deny it, may well be due to the small
infusion of the native blood which has admittedly taken place. It
may well be that certain qualities of the Red Indian, for example, the
straight dark hair and prominent cheek bones, are what the biologists
call &#8216;dominant characters&#8217; when the Indian is crossed with the
European; that is, qualities which always assert themselves in the
offspring, to the exclusion of the corresponding quality of the other
race involved in the cross. If that is so, a very small proportion
of Indian blood would suffice to make these features very common
throughout the population of America. As an exception to the supposed
law of direct hereditary adaptation to climate take the colour
of the skin. The black negroes live in the hot moist regions of Africa,
and it has been said that pigmentation is the hereditary effect of
a hot moist climate. But there are men of a different race who have
long lived in an equally hot and moist climate, but who do not show
this effect&mdash;namely, tribes in the heart of Borneo, right under the
equator, whose skins are hardly darker than the average English
skins and less dark than the Southern Europeans&#8217;. Take again the
indolence of the peoples of warm hot climates and the energy of
peoples of colder climates. These certainly seem to be racial qualities;
but their distribution is adequately explained by the indirect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
effect of physical environment exerted by way of natural selection; and
these differences of energy afford the best illustration of such indirect
action of physical environment in determining racial mental qualities.</p>

<p>Before considering the question further, let us note yet another
way in which the physical environment affects men&#8217;s minds and has
been supposed directly to induce certain racial qualities. Buckle
pointed out with great force the influence on the mind of what he
called the external aspects of nature. He showed that where, as in
India and the greater part of Asia, the physical features of a country
are planned upon a very large scale; where the mountains are huge,
where rivers are of immense length and volume, where plains are of
boundless extent, and the sun very hot, there the forces of nature
are exerted with an intensity that renders futile the best efforts of
man, at any rate of man in a state of low civilisation, to cope with
them. In such countries men are exposed to calamities on an
enormous scale, great floods, violent storms and deluges of rain,
earthquakes, excessive droughts resulting in famine and plague; and
they are exposed to the attacks of many dangerous animal species,
which are bred by the great heat in the dense and unconquerable
forests. These disasters have repeatedly occurred on a scale such
that in comparison with them the recent earthquake in California
appears a mere trifle. Millions have been destroyed in a few hours
in some of the floods of the Yellow River of China.</p>

<p>The magnitude of these objects and the appalling and irresistible
character of such devastating forces produce, said Buckle, two
principal and closely allied effects upon the mind; they stimulate
the imagination to run riot in extravagant and grotesque fancies;
at the same time, they discourage any attempt to cope with these
great forces and to understand their laws, and thus keep men perpetually
in fearful uncertainty as to their fate; for they cannot hope
to control it by their own unaided efforts.</p>

<p>Hence, the encouragement of superstition; hence, the dominance
of a degrading religion of fear throughout the greater part of such
regions; hence, the supremacy of priests and religious orders and the
discouragement of scientific reasoning. Hence, in the arts, the
literature, and the religion of India, we see a dominant tendency to
the grotesque, the enormous, the fearful; we see gods portrayed
with many arms, with three eyes and terrible visages. The legends
of their heroes contain monstrous details, as that they lived for
many thousands or millions of years. &#8220;All this,&#8221; says Buckle, &#8220;is
but a part of that love of the remote, that straining after the infinite,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and that indifference to the present, which characterises every branch
of Indian intellect. Not only in literature, but also in religion and
in art, this tendency is supreme. To subdue the understanding, and
indulge the imagination, is the universal principle. In the principles
of their theology, in the character of their gods, and even in the
form of their temples, we see how the sublime and threatening
aspects of the external world have filled the mind of the people with
those images of the grand and the terrible, which they strive to
reproduce in a visible form, and to which they owe the leading
peculiarities of their national culture.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>That these peculiarities of the mental life of such peoples are
causally related with those terrible aspects of nature is, I think,
sufficiently established by Buckle. But if we admit this, there
remain two questions: (1) Have these tendencies become innate
racial qualities? (2) If so, how have they been rendered innate?
Buckle did not raise these questions and offered no opinion in regard
to them. But he seems to have assumed that these tendencies have
become innate; and there is much to be said for that view. Yet, if
that could be shown conclusively, it still would not prove inheritance
of these acquired qualities. It may have resulted in some such way
as this: the physical environment stimulates the imagination, and it
represses the tendency to control imagination and superstition by
reason and calm inquiry after causes; acting thus upon successive
generations of men, it determines the peculiarities of the religious
system and of the art and literature of the people. Individuals in
whom the same tendencies are innately strong will then flourish
under such a system; whereas those whose innate tendencies are in
the direction of reason and scepticism will find the system uncongenial,
unfavourable for the exercise of their best powers; they will
fail to make their mark; they may, as in many instances of European
inquirers, actually have lost their lives or their liberty through the
religious zeal of those who maintain the traditional system. Thus
the social environment, working through long ages, may have
constantly determined a certain degree of selection of the innate
tendencies congenial to it, and a weeding out of the opposed tendencies;
until the former have predominated in the race<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>We have here a very important principle which we must constantly
bear in mind&mdash;namely, that not only the physical environment, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
also the social environment, may determine the survival of those
temperaments and qualities of mind best fitted to thrive in it, and,
by handicapping those least fitted to it, may gradually bring the
mental qualities of the race into conformity with itself. We shall
later see other examples by which this principle is more clearly
illustrated.</p>

<p>We conclude that, while physical environment may act powerfully
upon the minds of individuals, moulding their acquired qualities
in the three ways noticed&mdash;namely, influencing the mind through
bodily habit, through the senses, and through the imagination&mdash;there
is no sufficient evidence that the acquired qualities so induced ever
become innate or racial characters by direct transmission. In those
instances in which the racial qualities approximate to these direct
effects of physical environment, it may well be because the physical
environment has brought about adaptation of the race by long
continued selection of individuals, or because it has determined
peculiarities of social environment, which in turn have brought about
adaptation of the racial qualities by long continued selection.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h4>THE RACE-MAKING PERIOD (<i>continued</i>)</h4>

<p>We considered in our last chapter the principal modes in which
physical environment affects the character of a people&mdash;namely,
(1) influence on temperament exerted chiefly through climate acting
upon the bodily functions: (2) influence through the senses, exerting
secondary effects upon the higher mental processes: (3) direct
influence on the imagination. We concluded that these effects
become innate in some degree; though whether they are impressed
on the race by direct inheritance, or by processes of direct or of
social selection, or in all three ways, remains an open question.</p>

<p>We distinguished, besides these direct modes of influence, two
indirect modes by which physical environment affects the mind and
character of a people: (1) by its selective action on individuals apart
from its influence upon their minds: (2) by determining occupations
and social organisation. We may consider them in turn.</p>

<p>It is recognised, as I pointed out above, that the races inhabiting
hot moist countries are commonly indolent, while those of the
moderately cold and moist climates tend to be extremely active
and energetic.</p>

<p>This difference is well brought out by Mr Meredith Townsend in
an essay on the charm of Asia for the Asiatics<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; and he is speaking
not of Asia in general but of Southern Asia. He says Asiatics &#8220;will
not, under any provocation, burden themselves with a sustained
habit of taking trouble. You might as well ask lazzaroni to behave
like Prussian officials.&#8221; After quoting Thiers&#8217; description of the
immense labours of detailed administration which he supported
while minister of State, he says &#8220;No Asiatic will do that.... One
half the weakness of every Oriental government arises from the
impossibility of finding men who will act as M. Thiers did.&#8221; These
races, bred in the tropics, are in fact incurable lotus-eaters, their
chief desire is for the afternoon life or, as is commonly said of the
Malays throughout the Eastern Archipelago, they are great leg-swingers,
they prefer to undertake no labour more arduous than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
sitting still swinging their legs. All this, though more or less true
of the tropical races in general, is pre-eminently true of those
inhabiting regions which are moist as well as hot, the Malays, the
Burmese, the Siamese, the Papuans, the Negroes of the African
jungle regions.</p>

<p>Such peoples have failed to acquire the energy which leads men
to delight in activity for its own sake, not merely because a hot
moist climate inclines directly to indolence, but rather because the
prime necessities of life are to be had almost without labour; the
heat dispenses with the necessity for clothing and shelter, while the
hot sun and the moisture provide an abundance of vegetable food
in response to a minimum of labour. Hence, no man perishes through
lack of energy to secure the prime necessities of life; and there has
been no great weeding out of the indolent by severe conditions of
life, such as alone can produce an innately energetic race, one that
loves activity for its own sake. For the same reason these same
peoples also exercise but little foresight, they are naturally improvident;
the abundance of nature renders it possible to survive
and propagate without any prudent provision for the future.</p>

<p>Contrast with these races the northerly races&mdash;in Asia the Japanese,
whose energy and industry we all recognise, and the northern
Mongols or Tartars, who have so often overrun and conquered with
fire and sword the less energetic peoples of the south, or the Goorkhas
or Pathans of the highlands of northern India. But more especially
contrast with them the English people. M. Boutmy rightly asserts
that &#8220;the taste for and the habit of effort must be regarded as the
most essential attribute, the profound and spontaneous quality, of
the race<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.&#8221; It is displayed in the English love of sport and adventure
and travel, especially in such recreations as mountain climbing,
which is pre-eminently an English sport; also throughout our social
life, in the intensity of commercial and industrial activity, often
carried on ardently by men far removed from any necessity of making
money. In our political life, where a vast amount of effort is constantly
expended in achieving comparatively small results, we
always seem to prefer to achieve any reform by the methods which
give scope to and demand the greatest amount of public activity
and effort. It is shewn also in the immense amount of public
service rendered without remuneration, for the mere love of
activity and the exercise of power. It is very striking in English
colonies in tropical lands, and has been no doubt an important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
factor in our success in tropical administration and in
colonisation.</p>

<p>Boutmy is inclined to attribute to this love of activity, as a
secondary effect, the dislike of the mass of Englishmen for generalisations
and for theoretical construction; for, he says, these are the
results naturally achieved by the reflective mind, whereas the English
mind gets no time for reflection, its attention is perpetually drawn
off from general principles by its tendency to pursue some immediate
practical end. Hence, he says, abstraction is subordinated to practical
ends and does not soar for its own sake. This truth is well illustrated
by the fact that all our English philosophers, Bacon, Hobbes, Locke,
Mill, Bentham, Spencer, etc., have been practical moralists, and
have conducted their investigations always with an eye to concrete
applications to the conduct of the State or of private life.</p>

<p>Boutmy regards this love of activity, together with foresight
and self-control, as racial qualities engendered by the severity of
the climate, working chiefly by way of natural selection. In the
prehistoric period more especially, when man had little knowledge
of means of protection from climate and hardship such as have
been developed by civilised societies, those individuals who were
deficient in these qualities must have succumbed to the rigours
of the climate, leaving their more energetic fellows to propagate
the race.</p>

<p>That there is truth in the view is shown by the fact that the
degree to which the love of activity is developed seems to vary
roughly with the severity of the climate even among the closely
allied races of Europe. As we pass northward from the coast of the
Mediterranean, we find the quality more and more strongly marked;
and it is in accordance with this principle that the dominant power,
the leadership in civilisation, has passed gradually northwards in
the historic period. Civilisation first developed in the sub-tropical
regions, in which the abundance of nature first gave men leisure to
devote themselves to things of the mind, to contemplation and
inquiry; while the northern races were still battling as savages
against the inclemency of the climate, were still being ruthlessly
weeded out by the rigorousness of the physical environment, and so
were being adapted to it, that is to say, were being rendered capable
of sustained and vigorous effort. But, as the means of subduing
nature and of protecting himself against nature have been developed
by man, the dominance has passed successively northwards to
peoples whose innate energy and love of activity were more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
highly developed in proportion to the severity of the selection
exerted upon many preceding generations.</p>

<p>The severe climate has not been the only cause of this evolution
of an energetic active type. No doubt military selection played its
part also. The Northern races of Europe, more particularly the
Nordic, the fair-haired long-headed race, underwent a prolonged
and severe process of such military group selection, before branches
of it settled in our island; and, among the qualities which must have
tended to success and survival in this process, energy and capacity
for prolonged and frequent effort, especially bodily effort, must have
been one of the chief. Still, even such group selection was probably
a secondary result of the direct climatic selection; for it must have
been the love of activity and enterprise that led these peoples perpetually
to wander, and so to come into conflicts with one another,
conflicts in which the more energetic would in the main survive
and the less energetic succumb. In part also it must have been
determined in the third and the most indirect manner in which
physical environment shapes racial qualities&mdash;namely, by determining
occupations and modes of life, and through these the
forms of social organisation, both of which then react upon the
racial qualities.</p>

<p>In illustration of this third mode of action of physical conditions,
let us take a striking difference of mental quality between the French
and the English peoples, and inquire how the difference has arisen;
a difference which is recognised by every capable observer who has
compared the two peoples and which has been of immense importance
in shaping the history of the modern world. I mean the greater
sociability of the French and the greater independence of the English,
a greater self-reliance and capacity for individual initiative. The
difference finds expression in every aspect of the national life of the
two peoples. The sociability and sympathetic character of the French,
on which they justly pride themselves<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>, is the inverse aspect of their
lack of the characteristic English qualities, independence and self-reliance.
In political life the difference appears in the centralised
organisation of the French nation, every detail of administration
being controlled by the central power through a rigidly organised
hierarchy of officials, in a way that leaves no scope for initiative
and independence in local administrations. Connected with this is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the almost universal desire of educated men to become state functionaries,
parts of the official machinery of administration, and the
consequent excessive growth of this class of persons.</p>

<p>The same quality of the French shows itself in the tendency to
prefer the monarchical rule of any man who shows himself capable
of ruling, a tendency which constantly besets the republican State
with a well-recognised danger. These are not local and temporary
manifestations, but have characterised the French nation throughout
the whole period of its existence. In the feudal period which preceded
its formation, there was considerable local independence; but the
feudal system was due to the dominant influence of Frankish chiefs,
of the same race as our Saxon forefathers, who overran most of
France as a ruling caste, but did not contribute any large element
to the population, and whose blood therefore has been largely
swamped. It appears in the greater violence among the French
people of collective mental processes, those of mobs, assemblies,
factions, and groups of all kinds. Each individual is easily carried
away by the mass; there are none to withstand the wave of contagion
and, by so doing, to break and check its force.</p>

<p>In England on the other hand political activity has always been
characterised by extreme jealousy of the central power, and by the
tendency to achieve everything possible by local action and voluntary
private effort. All reforms are initiated from the periphery, instead
of from the centre as in France. Great institutions, the universities,
schools, colleges, hospitals, railways, canals, docks, insurance companies,
even water supplies and telephones and many other things
which, it would seem, should naturally and properly be undertaken
by the State, or other official public body, have been generally set on
foot and worked by individuals or private associations of individuals.
Even vast colonial empires&mdash;India, Rhodesia, Canada, Sarawak,
Nigeria, North Borneo&mdash;have been in the main acquired through the
enterprise and efforts of individuals or associations of individuals;
the State only intervening when the main work has been accomplished.</p>

<p>In their religion, too, the English are markedly individualistic;
our numerous dissenting bodies have mostly dispensed with the
centralised official hierarchy which in Roman Catholic countries
mediates between God and man, and have insisted upon a direct
communion with God; and we have many little churches each of
which governs itself in absolute independence of every other. In
the family relations the same difference appears very strongly. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
French family regards itself, and is regarded by law, as a community
which holds its goods in common; each child has his legal claim
upon his share, relies upon his family for support in his struggle
with the world, and is encouraged by his parents to do so. In
the English family, on the other hand, the father is a supreme
despot, who disposes of his property as he wills. The children are
not encouraged to look for further support, when once they become
adult, but are taught that they must go out into the world to seek
their fortunes unaided. At an early age, the English boy is usually
thrust out of the family into the life of a school in which, by his
own efforts, he must find and keep his position among his fellows; and
he lives a life which, compared with that of the French boy, is one
of freedom and independence. In the distribution of the people on
the land we see the same difference of mental qualities revealed.
The French peasants are for the most part congregated sociably in
villages and small towns; the English farmer builds his homestead
apart upon his own domain. And this determines one of the most
striking differences in the aspect of the rural districts of both
countries. In the towns also the same tendencies are clearly shown;
in the separate little homes of the English and in the large houses
of the French shared by several families.</p>

<p>It is in the expansion in the world of the two peoples that the
effects of this difference are most clearly expressed and assume the
greatest importance. The English race has populated a vast proportion
of the surface of the world, and rules over one-fifth of
the total population. Whereas the French people, who have conquered
large areas, have never succeeded in permanently colonising
any considerable portion of their conquests and they have failed to
maintain their domination in many regions where they have for
a time established it. In every extra-European region where they
have come into conflict with the English race they have been worsted.</p>

<p>The secret of the difference in the expansion of the two peoples
is the difference of innate mental quality that we are considering,
enhanced by the differences of custom and of political and family
organisation engendered by it. For, like all other innate tendencies,
the two to which we are referring obtain accentuated expression
through moulding customs, institutions and social organisation in
ways which foster in successive generations just those tendencies of
which these institutions are themselves the traditional outcome and
expression. Thus, it is the individualistic nature of the political,
religious, and family organisation of the English people which, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
been engendered by innate independence of character and having in
turn accentuated it in each generation, has enabled the people to
achieve its marvels of colonisation and tropical administration. We
see these tendencies playing a predominant part in the history of
every British colony.</p>

<p>The difference was well brought out by Volney, a French observer
of the French and English colonists in the early days of the settlement
of North America. He wrote &#8220;The French colonist deliberates with
his wife upon everything that he proposes to do; often the plans fall
to the ground through lack of agreement.&#8221; &#8220;To visit one&#8217;s neighbours,
to chat with them, is for the French an habitual need so
imperious that on all the frontier of Louisiana and Canada you will
not find a single French colonist established beyond sight of his
neighbour&#8217;s home.&#8221; &#8220;On the other hand, the English colonist, slow
and taciturn, passes the whole day continuously at work; at breakfast
he coldly gives his orders to his wife; ... and goes forth to labour....
If he finds an opportunity to sell his farm at a profit, he does so and
goes ten or twenty leagues further into the wilderness to make
himself a new home<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the French authors themselves who have most insisted upon
this mental difference between the French and the English, which
seems to be determining a great difference in the destinies of the
two peoples; and most of them, while justly valuing the sympathetic
and sociable quality of the French mind, deeply regret its lack of
the English independence<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. There has been no lack of speculation
and inquiry as to the origin and causes of this supremely important
difference. It is perhaps worth while to glance at some of these
attempts.</p>

<p>The most superficial attempt at explanation is to say that the
political and social institutions of the French people foster in each
individual the social tendencies in question, while the English institutions
develop their opposites. It is true, but it obviously
is not the explanation of the difference; for that we must go further
back, in order to find the origin of these differences of institution.</p>

<p>An explanation a little less superficial is that the domination of
the first Napoleon and the strong centralised system of administration
established by him accounts for the difference. But the permanence,
if not the very possibility, of that system, and the rise to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
power of Napoleon himself, were but symptoms of this deep-lying
tendency of the French mind.</p>

<p>Buckle, recognising the profound difference which we are considering,
summed it up in the phrases &#8216;the dominance of the protective
spirit in France&#8217; and of &#8216;the spirit of independence in England,&#8217;
He attributed the former partly to the influence of the Roman Catholic
Church in France with its centralised authoritative system, partly to
the long prevalence of the feudal system of social organisation, under
which every man was made to feel his personal dependence upon
the despotic power of an independent noble and was accustomed
to look to him for all initiative and guidance&mdash;was trained to
obey a despot, whose absolute jurisdiction and whose title to
his lands and rights was unchallenged. The system, he said,
culminated in the despotism of Louis XIV, by the subjection of the
previously independent nobles to the king, and was revived in a
different form, immediately after the great revolution, by Napoleon.</p>

<p>The dominance of the spirit of independence among the English
people he would explain also from the character of their political institutions
during recent centuries. After recounting the political history
of England from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, and after
showing how the people during that period repeatedly succeeded in
asserting its liberties against the encroachments of the kings, he wrote&mdash;&#8220;In
England the course of affairs, which I have endeavoured to trace
since the sixteenth century, had diffused among the people a knowledge
of their own resources and a skill and independence in the use
of them, imperfect indeed, but still far superior to that possessed by
any other of the great European countries,&#8221; But he was not wholly
satisfied with this explanation; he added&mdash;&#8220;Besides this, other
circumstances, which will be hereafter related, had, as early as the
eleventh century, begun to affect our national character and had
assisted in imparting to it that sturdy boldness, and at the same
time, those habits of foresight, and of cautious reserve, to which
the English mind owes its leading peculiarities.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we turn to his account of the primary cause of English
independence<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, we find that it was, in his view, that the feudal
system was established by William the Conqueror in a form different
from that obtaining on the continent. The nobles received their
lands directly from the king as grants, and all land owners were made
to acknowledge their direct obligation to him. The nobles were in
consequence too weak to set up their own power against that of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the king, and therefore they called the people to their aid in resisting
the power of the king; hence, the people early acquired rights and
privileges and the habit of organised resistance to the central
authority. &#8220;The English aristocracy, being thus forced by their own
weakness, to rely on the people, it naturally followed that the
people imbibed that tone of independence and that lofty bearing,
of which our civil and political institutions are the consequence,
rather than the cause. It is to this, and not to any fanciful peculiarity
of race, that we owe the sturdy and enterprising spirit for
which the inhabitants of this island have long been remarkable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The practice of subinfeudation, became in France almost
universal.&#8221; The great lords subgranted parts of their lands to
lesser lords, and these again to others, and so on&mdash;&#8220;thus forming a
long chain of dependence, and, as it were, organising submission
into a system.&#8221; In this country, on the other hand, the practice was
actively checked. &#8220;The result was that by the fourteenth century
the liberties of Englishmen were secured,&#8221; and the spirit of independence
had become a part of the national character; that is to say,
Buckle maintained that three centuries of a different form of the
feudal system sufficed to produce this profound difference between
the French and English peoples.</p>

<p>Boutmy also fully recognises the important difference between
the innate qualities of the French and English; and he also would
explain it as the effect of political institutions since the middle ages,
but on lines somewhat different from Buckle&#8217;s&mdash;namely, that England
was early ruled by a king invested with great power, and inclined
to all the excesses of arbitrary rule. Hence the first need of the
people was to fortify themselves against his power. All the law of
England carries the imprint of this fear and this defiance. The
parliament has been set up against the crown, the judges against
parliament, and the jury against the power of the judges; and so,
ever since the conquest, individuals have been accustomed to think,
and to assert, that their persons, their purse, and their homes are
inviolable; and that the State is an enemy whose encroachments
must be resisted. This way of thinking has by long usage become
instinctive, increasing from generation to generation; until the horror
of servitude has become rooted in the Englishman&#8217;s temperament,
and the desire of independence has become a native and primary
passion.</p>

<p>Both Buckle and Boutmy agree, then, that the English love of
liberty is due to England having been conquered and ruled by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
powerful king, and that in France the opposite effect is to be attributed
to the same cause&mdash;namely, the influence of despotic rulers.
Surely this is to reverse cause and effect. If the English people had
not already possessed the sturdy spirit of independence when they
were conquered by the Norman, his strong centralised rule would
only have rendered them still less independent and would have
fostered the spirit of protection, as Buckle calls it. If the national
characters had been reversed in this respect, how easy it would have
been to show that the dependence of the English character was due
to the strong rule of a foreign despot, William of Normandy, while
the French independence was due to the existence in feudal times of
many centres of independent power, the nobles, each capable of
resisting the central authority! It was just because this spirit was
theirs already that the English people resisted their kings and were
able to secure their liberties by setting up institutions congenial to
their nature, institutions and customs which have fostered in each
individual and each generation the spirit of independence inherited
as a racial quality, and which possibly, though by no means certainly,
have further intensified the racial peculiarity.</p>

<p>Another cause for the difference of institutions is assigned by
Sir Henry Maine. He pointed to the great influence of Roman law upon
French institutions; he showed how the French lawyers, brought up
in the school of Roman law and holding the Roman Empire as the
ideal of a political organisation, threw all their weight upon the side
of the monarchy, and in favour of centralised administration. More,
perhaps, is due to this influence than to the causes assigned by Buckle
and Boutmy; but no one of these alleged causes, nor all of them
combined, can be accepted as adequate to explain the origin of the
difference of national characters. These authors fail also to make
clear how the political institutions can have modified character.
Boutmy frankly assumes use-inheritance, which, as I have said, is,
in the present state of science, an unwarrantable assumption.</p>

<p>That these qualities of the French and English peoples are innate
racial qualities, evolved during the race-making or prehistoric period,
is proved not only by the inadequacy of any assignable causes
operating during the historic period, but also by the fact that similar
qualities are described by the earliest historians as characterising
the ancestors, or the principal ancestral stocks, of the two peoples,
when they first appear in history. It is proved also by the fact that
other branches of the Nordic race have displayed similar qualities,
more especially the Dutch, and also the Normans, who, though they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
have long formed part of the French State in the political sense, and
have suffered most of the political influences assigned as causes of
the spirit of protection, not only displayed the spirit of independence
in the highest degree ten centuries ago, but are admitted to be
still distinguished from the bulk of the French people by the greater
individualism of their character, just as they are still markedly
different in physical traits. They offer one of the best examples of
fixity of the physical characters of a race. No one can travel in
Normandy without being struck by the very marked and distinctive
physical type, which, according to all accounts, is that of the Norman
who came over to England with the Conqueror; and there is every
reason to believe that the mental qualities of the race have been
equally fixed and enduring.</p>

<p>Julius Caesar, Tacitus, and other early historians have described
for us the leading qualities of the Gauls on the one hand and of
the Teutons on the other. Fouill&eacute;e in his <i>Psychology of the French
People</i> has brought together the evidence of these early historians
on the point; it shows that the Gauls and the Teutons were distinguished
very strongly by the same differences which obtain
between the French and English peoples at the present time,
especially the difference in respect of independence and initiative, the
origin of which we are seeking to explain. The Gauls were eminently
sociable people, sympathetic, emotional, demonstrative, vivacious,
very given to oratory and discussion, vain and moved by the desire
of glory, capable of great gallantry, but not of persevering effort in
face of difficulties, easily elated, easily cast down. And, what from
our point of view is especially important, they were readily led by
the chiefs, to whom they were attached by the bonds of personal
loyalty; and they were constantly banding themselves together in
large groups, under such leaders as attained popularity by their
superior qualities; and, again, they were dominated by the priestly
caste, the Druids. The Gauls even had those family institutions
which characterise the modern French and which have been
held to be the expression of their recently acquired qualities and
traditions; namely, the family had the character of a community
in which the wife had equal rights with the husband, and the children
were regarded also as members of the community having their equal
claims upon the family property. And society was bound together by
a system of patrons and clients, a system of personal dependence.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Teutonic people, as described by the same
ancient authorities, displayed a decided individualism in virtue of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
which their social organisation was more rudimentary. The father
was supreme in the family, and his power and property descended
to his eldest son. They were a more phlegmatic people, but of
great energy and persistence. Unlike the Gauls, they were dominated
by no priestly caste. The religious rites were conducted by the elder
men.</p>

<p>The Gauls were a mixed people of whom the minority, constituting
the nobility, were of the tall, fair, long-headed Nordic race, while the
majority, the mass of the common people, were of the short, dark,
round-headed race. And these, as the numerous observations of the
anthropologists show, constitute to-day the bulk of the population,
except in Normandy and the extreme north-east of France.</p>

<p>The Teutons or Germans of Caesar and Tacitus, on the other
hand, were of the fair Nordic race; and the Anglo-Saxons who
overran Britain, together with the Danes and Normans, who, with
the Saxons, formed the principal ancestral stock of the English, were
of this same Nordic race, or Northmen, as we may call them.</p>

<p>Now, it might seem useless to attempt to arrive at any conclusions
as to the influences that shaped these races in prehistoric times.
But an attempt has been made by one of the schools of French
sociologists, which, in spite of its speculative character, seems to be
worthy of attention. This is the school of &#8216;La Science Sociale,&#8217;
founded seventy years ago by Fredericq le Play and more recently
led by Ed. Demolins and H. de Tourville. Aided by a number
of ardent disciples, they have made a special study of the influence
of physical environment in determining occupations and social
organisation, and in moulding indirectly through these the mental
qualities of peoples. That is their great principle. They rightly, I
think, insist upon the relatively small importance of political institutions
in moulding a people, regarding them as secondary results of
the factors which, determining the private activities of men and
women at every moment of their lives from the cradle to the
grave, exert a far greater and more intimate influence upon their
minds. In two fascinating volumes<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Demolins has summed up the
principal results of this school and attempted to trace the conditions
that have determined the differentiation of all the principal races
of the earth; and de Tourville has applied the same principles and
traced their effects in European history<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the work of the Le Play school is almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
entirely ignored by the other French sociologists and anthropologists.
It is seldom referred to by them, and outside France also it has not
received the attention it deserves. Much of it is of the nature of
brilliant speculation, and is regarded no doubt as unsound by many
more sober minds. Yet, when we attempt to understand the evolution
of man in the prehistoric period, brilliant speculation becomes
a necessary supplement to the work of measuring skulls and
digging up ruins, to which some less ingenious workers confine
themselves. And, of all the conclusions of the Le Play school, their
account of the origin of the distinctive characters of the Northmen
is one of the most striking and satisfactory; while their account of
the origins of the Gauls and of their peculiar social organisation and
well marked mental traits is also among their best work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<h4>THE RACE-MAKING PERIOD (<i>continued</i>)</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Influence of Occupations and of Race-crossing</span></h4>

<p>In the foregoing chapter we noticed certain well-marked and generally
recognised differences of national character presented by the
French and the English peoples&mdash;namely, the greater independence
of the English, the greater sociability of the French people; and we
noted how these differences of national character show themselves
throughout the institutions of the two nations, and how they have
played a great part in determining the difference of their histories;
especially, we saw, how they are of prime importance, when we seek
to account for the greater expansion of the English people throughout
the world.</p>

<p>We then noticed several attempts that have been made, by
Buckle, Boutmy, Maine and others, to account for these differences
as results of differences of political institutions during the last
thousand years. We found that all these attempts fail, and that the
differences of political institutions, which these authors have regarded
as the causes of the differences of national character, are really the
expressions of a fundamental racial difference; that, in short, these
authors have inverted the true causal relation. I then drew attention
to the work of the school of Le Play and especially to its fundamental
principle&mdash;namely, that, while peoples are in a state of primitive
or lowly culture, their geographical or physical environment determines
their occupations and, through their occupations, their social
organisations, especially their domestic organisation; and that
particular modes of occupation and of social organisation of a
primitive people, persisting through many generations, mould the
innate qualities and form the racial character.</p>

<p>I said that two brilliant workers of the school&mdash;namely, Demolins
and de Tourville&mdash;had applied this principle to account for those
differences between the national characters of the French and
English peoples which we were considering. I have now to reproduce
their account in as condensed a form as possible.</p>

<p>Demolins claims to show that the short dark round-headed people,
who formed the bulk of the Gauls and also of the population
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of modern France, came, in prehistoric times, from the Eurasian
steppe region, reaching France by way of the valley of the Danube,
a long narrow lowland region confined on the north by the Carpathians
and mountains of Bohemia, on the south by the Balkans and Swiss
Alps. He supposes that, for long ages, they had lived as pastoral
nomads on the steppes. By examining the nomads who still lead the
pastoral life on the steppes, he shows the kind of social organisation
to which this pastoral life inevitably gives rise and under which they
lived; and he traces the effects which such occupation and such social
organisation produce on the mental qualities of a people.</p>

<p>The system is the patriarchal system <i>par excellence</i>. It
is something very different from the Roman system characterised
by the <i>patria potestas</i>, which the writings of Sir H. Maine have
perhaps tended to confuse with the true patriarchal system. The
patriarchal system of the pastoral nomads is essentially a communal
system, under which all the brothers, sons, and grandsons of the
patriarch form, with their families, a community which holds all the
property, consisting of flocks and herds, in common; each member
having his claim to his share of the produce, each doing his share
of the common labour, and each having a voice in the regulation of
the affairs of the family. Such a system represses individualism;
there is no individual property, there are no individual rights, duties,
or responsibilities; no scope for individual initiative; the individual
is swallowed up in the community; superior energy or enterprise
bring no superior rewards, but rather tend to social disorganisation
and to the detriment of the individual who displays them.
Further, the work of looking after the herds of cattle is easy and
delightful, calling for no sustained exertion; and the herds provide
every necessary article of food, clothing, and shelter. Beyond the
family group there exists no political organisation; for the group
is self-supporting and independent, it has no need of relations with
other groups, and each group lives far apart from others, wandering
in some ill-defined region of the immense plain.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of this social organisation and of this mode of
life are clearly created by the physical environment, by the boundless
grassy plains, which enable each family group to maintain a
large troup of cattle, chiefly horses. At the same time, these conditions
render necessary the co-operation of all the members of the
family in the common work of tending the cattle; while the necessity
of continually moving on to fresh pasture prevents the growth of any
fixed forms of property and of any more elaborate social organisation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an extremely stable and persistent mode of life and of
social organisation. So long as the geographical conditions remain
unchanged, it is difficult to see how any change would take place
in it, how any progress towards civilisation could begin. And, as a
matter of fact, the people who have remained in these regions continue
to lead just the same patriarchal, pastoral, nomadic life. Long
ages of this mode of life may well put upon a people the stamp
of sociability and communism and kill out individualism and
individual initiative! Demolins points out in a very interesting way
how these effects of the patriarchal system of the pastoral nomads
are displayed most clearly still by the population of southern Russia,
who, of all the settled European peoples descended from such
pastoral nomads, have suffered fewest disturbing influences; how
still the individual is subordinated to the community, to the <i>mir</i>,
by which all private life and industrial activity is directed and which
is the owner of the principal property, namely the land; and how, in
consequence, the people remain devoid of all individual initiative
and enterprise.</p>

<p>The Celts arriving in Gaul retained these qualities and something
of the patriarchal organisation, although they were no longer
simply pastoral nomads; for, in the course of their migrations, they
had been forced to take up agriculture and the rearing of other
domestic animals, especially the pig, through lack of sufficient open
steppe land. While in this disorganised condition in Gaul, they were
overrun by tribes of the Nordic race, who established themselves
as a conquering nobility, superimposing upon the rudimentary
political organisation of the Celts a loose military organisation of
clans; each clan was led by a popular warrior who attached to himself
by his personal qualities as large as possible a number of clients
or clansmen, acquiring rights over their land and property, in
return for the patronage and protection he offered them. These
nobles with their blood relatives were the tall fair-haired Gauls
described by Caesar. The Celts lent themselves readily to this
system based on personal loyalty and leadership, owing to their
lack of independence of character engendered by long ages of the
patriarchal communal r&eacute;gime. And the new social organisation
fostered and developed still more through many generations the
spirit of dependence, the tendency to look for authoritative guidance
and control to some recognised centre of power.</p>

<p>Under the two circumstances, the long r&eacute;gime of patriarchal communism
and the subsequent prevalence for many generations of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
clan system, we may see, according to Demolins, the causes of
those deep-seated tendencies of the French nation (summed up by
Buckle in the phrase the spirit of protection) which throughout their
history have played so large a part in shaping the destinies of the
people, and which are still the source of grave anxiety to many
patriotic Frenchmen.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that among the Celtic populations of the
British Isles the same features have been clearly displayed. We
see among them the clan-system with its dual ownership of the soil,
which has been perpetuated in Ireland to the present day and has
received more formal and legal recognition from the British government
in its recent legislation. We see the strong clannish spirit and
relative lack of independence. These qualities are clearly shown by the
Celtic Irish, even when they have been compelled by necessity to emigrate
to America. There they are not found to be pioneers on the
frontiers of civilisation, but rather remain herded together in clannish
communities in the cities of the eastern states, where they create
such powerful unofficial associations as &#8216;Tammany Hall.&#8217;</p>

<p>Demolins&#8217; account of the genesis of the spirit of independence and
enterprise of the Anglo-Saxons is still more interesting and seductive.
He supposes that their ancestors also came originally in very
remote times from the Eurasian steppes; but that is a disputable
point and forms no essential part of his argument. They settled
in prehistoric times around the coasts of the Baltic and the North
Sea, especially in Scandinavia. And the physical peculiarities of this
region impressed upon their descendants the qualities which have
enabled them to play a leading part in the destruction of the Roman
power and in the development of the civilisation of modern Europe,
and which have established them in almost every part of the world
as a dominant race, increasing in power and numbers at the expense
of other peoples.</p>

<p>What, then, are these physical conditions?</p>

<p>Scandinavia is a mass of barren mountains coming down in
almost all parts abruptly to the sea. Its coast line is indented by
innumerable fiords and bordered by thousands of small islands; and
the sea which washes these coasts is warmed by the Gulf Stream.
This sea, owing to its warmth and to the existence of a great bank
which lies near the surface and runs parallel to the coast line, is
extremely rich in fish. Hence, the Nordic tribes who settled in
Scandinavia inevitably became a sea-faring folk, spreading slowly
along the coasts in small boats, supporting themselves in large part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
upon the fish which they caught in the sea; for the land is barren,
while the sea offers ideal conditions for fishing in small boats. But,
unlike the herds of pastoral peoples, sea-fishing does not provide
all the necessities of a simple life. It must be combined with agriculture.
Hence, the ancient Northmen became a race of hardy
seafarers who at the same time practised agriculture.</p>

<p>The character of the land which was available for the necessary
but supplementary agriculture was all important. It consisted, as
it does still, of small isolated strips of cultivatable soil at the feet
of the mountains where they plunge into the sea. On such land it
was impossible for the family to retain the form of a patriarchal
community. The fertile areas were too small to support such
communities, and the individualistic form of family was inevitably
evolved. On each small plot of cultivatable land a little farm was
formed, a homestead in which lived a family restricted to father,
mother, and children. As the children grew up, it was impossible to
support them on the one small farm or to divide it among them; one
son alone was chosen as the inheritor of the paternal farm; and each
of the others had to seek a new piece of land, build a new homestead,
and acquire his own boat.</p>

<p>Thus, the family was forced to become the individualistic family;
and the home of each such family was necessarily isolated, widely
separated from that of every other, owing to the scattered distribution
of the little areas of fertile soil. Thus were formed the first
homes in the English sense of the word; the home in which the father
rules supreme over his own little household, brooking no interference
from outside; the home in which the children are brought up to look
forward to establishing, each child for himself, similar independent
individualistic homes. Such homes have been established by the
Northmen in every part of the world in which they have settled;
and they are peculiar to them and their descendants.</p>

<p>It is obvious that all the very limited domains of the Scandinavian
coasts must have been fully occupied in the way described in a comparatively
few generations after the process of settlement began. This
seems to have occurred about the fourth or fifth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Then
the younger sons, for whom there was no place at home and for whom
there remained no spots suitable for homesteads in their native land,
were sent out into the world to seek their fortunes. They banded
themselves together to man single boats, or formed fleets of boats;
and, leaving their parents and women-folk behind, set out to conquer
for themselves new homesteads. Large numbers, sailing to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
southern shores of the Baltic and up the Weser and the Elbe, settled
on the plains of Saxony; and from this new centre they again spread,
as the Anglo-Saxons to England, and as the Franks to Gaul. Others
settled directly in northern France and became the Normans.
Others, the Varegs, penetrated the plains of Russia and established
themselves as princes over the Slav population.</p>

<p>This was a migration such as had never before been seen; bands
of armed men, all young or in the prime of life, coming not as mere
robbers, but seeking to conquer for themselves and to settle upon
whatever land seemed to them most desirable. Everywhere they
went they conquered and either exterminated or drove out the
indigenous population, as in the south and east of England, or established
themselves as an aristocracy, a ruling military caste, as the
Franks in the north-east of Gaul. And everywhere they established
firmly their individualistic social organisation, especially the isolated
homestead of the individualistic family, characterised by the despotic
power of the father and by great regard for individual property
and for the rights of the individual as against all State institutions
and public powers. In hostile countries the homestead became a
fortified place, or at least was furnished with a fortified keep or
castle; and in those regions, such as Gaul, in which the indigenous
population was not exterminated, the feudal system was thus
initiated. Everywhere they carried their spirit of independence,
enterprise, and initiation.</p>

<p>It was the swarming of the young broods of Northmen in search
of new homes that caused the Romans to describe these Northern
lands as the womb of peoples, and to regard them with wonder and
something of fear.</p>

<p>These qualities and habits continued to be displayed in the
highest degree by the Normans after their first settlement in the
north of France. The younger sons kept up the good old fashion
of going out into the world to seek a fortune or rather a territory,
which often was a dukedom or a kingdom. Their most characteristic
performance was the conquest of the greater part of Italy. A little
before William of Normandy and his companions secured for themselves
domains in this country, Norman knights, engaging in enterprises
that might well have seemed absolutely foolhardy, had
established themselves in Mediterranean lands. Some two thousand
Normans, arriving Viking fashion in their small ships, conquered
Sicily and the south of Italy and divided these lands among themselves;
and for a time they introduced order and a settled mode of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
life among the peoples of those parts. The leading spirits among
them were ten sons of one Norman gentleman, Tancr&egrave;de de
Hauteville, the father of twelve sons of whom two only remained
at home, while each of the others carved out for himself a domain
in Italy. As Demolins remarks, these families, retaining undiminished
their individualistic tendencies and spirit of independence, were
veritable factories of men for exportation.</p>

<p>The modern Frenchman, says Demolins, would regard as the
height of folly the enterprises of the old Northmen, who, mounted
on their frail ships, quitted each spring the coast of Scandinavia,
launched out on the wild sea, landed, a mere handful of men, on the
coasts of Germany, Britain, or Gaul, and there with their swords
carved out domains and made new homesteads. It was thus that
the ancestors of Tancred had acquired the manor of Hauteville, and
it was thus that his sons conquered Italy and Sicily.</p>

<p>It was in a very similar way that, in a later age, men of the same
breed carried to the new world the same individualistic institutions
and the same spirit of independence, and in doing so, laid the sure
foundations of the immense vigour and prosperity of the American
people.</p>

<p>There is one almost more striking illustration of the great and
lasting effects upon character and institutions of the mode of life
of the Northmen determined by their physical environment. It
is furnished by the character and habits of the people who still
dwell in the plains between the mouths and lower parts of the Weser
and the Elbe, a region which was naturally one of the first to be
conquered and occupied by the Northmen. This territory is an
infertile sandy plain, and at the time of the coming of the Northmen
had but scanty population; hence, instead of becoming the military
and ruling caste of a subject people, the Northmen became themselves
peasants and farmers. In doing so, they retained all the
characteristic features of the individualistic family and have perpetuated
them, together with the spirit of enterprise and independence,
undiminished to the present day.</p>

<p>In this region each farm is a freehold which has remained in the
hands of the same family for long periods, in many cases for hundreds
of years. Each farm has its isolated homestead inhabited by the
head of the family, his wife and young children, and one or two
hired servants. Each homestead is well nigh completely self-supporting
and lives almost independent of the outside world.
In spite of the isolation, which might have been expected to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
engender an extreme conservatism and backwardness of culture,
these farmers have continued to exhibit the old Northmen&#8217;s spirit
of enterprise and their power of voluntary combination in the
pursuit of individual ends. They were the first in Europe to
establish a society for the scientific study of agriculture, and they
have thus maintained themselves in the first rank as cultivators of
the land, quite without State assistance. In the same way and at an
early date they established schools for their children. They have
continued to produce large families and have retained the custom
of handing over the farm and homestead intact to one son, chosen
for his ability to manage it; while all the other sons keep up the
old custom of going out into the world to seek their fortunes, in
the shape of new homesteads.</p>

<p>Most striking of all, they still do this in the old Norse fashion as
nearly as possible. In one district these farmers combined their
efforts some sixty years ago and built a ship which, since that time,
has sailed every year to South Africa, carrying there the surplus
sons in search of new domains for themselves. In that far country
their spirit of independence finds satisfaction in establishing new
homesteads, new families of the individualistic type, and in perpetuating
their traditions of enterprise and self-reliance.</p>

<p>It is because the modern Scandinavians are of the same stock,
fashioned for long ages by the same physical environment, that they
have continued to emigrate in large numbers to North America,
where some of their ancestral race landed centuries before Columbus
was born, and where, in the newly opened territories of Canada and
the United States, they are generally recognised as being among the
best of the settlers.</p>

<p>Demolins does not enter into the question&mdash;How did the institutions
and mode of life of these or other peoples, determined
by physical environment, bring about adaptation of racial qualities
to the environment? He seems to assume in all cases use-inheritance.
But if, as seems possible or even probable, this is a false assumption,
we may still see clearly that, in the case of the Northmen at least,
adaptation may well have been effected by selection. The conditions
of life of these Northmen were such that in each generation the
majority of men could become fathers of families only after carrying
through successfully an enterprise in which a bold independence of
spirit was the prime condition of success.</p>

<p>Those who were deficient in the spirit of independence must
have shrunk from these wild expeditions in search of new homes to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
be won only by the sword, or must in the main have failed to attain
the end; remaining at home, or returning there after failing in the
enterprise to which they proved unequal, to finish their days as
bachelor uncles at the paternal hearth. This process, carried on
for many generations, would lead to the evolution of just those
qualities which are characteristic of their descendants in all the
many parts of the earth where they now rule. Not only must such
social selection have been operative during the period of settlement
of Scandinavia; but each great migration to a new area must have
sifted out the most independent and enterprising spirits to be the
founders and fathers of the new branch of the race<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. Thus the
descendants of the pilgrim fathers were the product of three such
processes of severe selection; the migration from Scandinavia to
Northern Germany; that from Germany to England; and that from
England to America. No wonder that they proved themselves well
able to cope with the hardships and dangers of a new continent
inhabited by savages only less fiercely tempered than their own stock
by many generations of warfare! When we thus find the same
institutions and the same mental traits characterising, from the
dawn of history to the present time, all the widely separated
branches of one racial stock and of this stock alone, we realize
how powerful over the destiny of nations is the influence of racial
character formed in the long prehistoric ages; we see how futile it
is to attempt to explain the mental traits of a people by the history
of their political institutions during a few recent centuries; we
understand that these institutions are the effects, not the causes,
of those mental qualities and that, even among the peoples who
have attained the highest degree of civilisation, racial qualities
remain of supreme importance.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Crossing of Races</span></h4>

<p>Before passing on to the consideration of evolutionary changes
during the historic period, a few words must be said about the
crossing and blending of races. Such blending has been, no doubt,
one of the principal causes of the great variety of human types at
present existing on the earth. It has been going on for long ages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
in almost all regions; but especially in Europe and Africa. All
existing stocks (with few exceptions) are the products of race-blending.
No one of the existing European peoples is of unmixed
stock; every one is the product of successive mixtures and blendings
of allied stocks; and the mixing and blending still goes on; while
in America (both north and south) the greatest experiments in race-blending
that the world has yet seen are taking place before our eyes.</p>

<p>Authors differ widely as to the results of the crossing of human
races and subraces. Some assert that the effect of crossing of races
is always bad, that the cross-bred progeny is always inferior to the
parent stocks. They make no allowance for unfavourable conditions,
especially the lack of the strong moral traditions of old organised
societies. Others maintain the opposite opinion. Both opinions are
probably correct in a certain sense. I think the facts enable us
to make with some confidence the following generalisation. The
crossing of the most widely different stocks, stocks belonging to
any two of the four main races of man, produces an inferior race;
but the crossing of stocks belonging to the same principal race, and
especially the crossing of closely allied stocks, generally produces a
blended subrace superior to the mean of the two parental stocks, or
at least not inferior.</p>

<p>This generalisation cannot yet be based on exact and firmly
established data, unfortunately; but it is in harmony with old
established popular beliefs, and with what we know of the crossing
of animal breeds; and it is borne out by a general inspection of many
examples. For instance, the blending of the white, negro, and
American stocks, which has been going on in South America for
some centuries, seems to have resulted in a subrace which up to the
present time is inferior to the parent races; or at any rate to the
white race. So the mulattoes of North America and the West Indies,
although superior in some respects to the pure negroes, seem deficient
in vitality and fertility, and the race does not maintain itself. The
Eurasians of India are commonly said to be a comparatively feeble
people. The blend of the Caucasian with the yellow race is also
generally of a poor type. Examples abound in Java of people of
mixed Javanese and Dutch blood; and they are for the most part
feeble specimens of humanity. It is generally recognised that a
recently blended stock may produce a few individuals of exceptional
vigour and capacity and physical beauty. But setting these aside,
the blended stock seems to be inferior in two respects: (1) a general
lack of vigour, which expresses itself in lack of power of resistance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to many diseases and in relative infertility; so that the blended
stock can hardly maintain its numbers; (2) a lack of harmony of
qualities, both mental and physical. It may be that such lack of
harmony is the ground of the relative infertility of blended stocks.
It expresses itself in the inharmonious combination of physical
features, characteristic of the mongrel. The negro race has a beauty
of its own, which is spoilt by blending.</p>

<p>As regards mental constitution, although we cannot directly
observe and measure these disharmonies of composition, there
seems good reason to believe that they exist. The soul of the cross-bred
is, it would seem, apt to be the scene of perpetual conflict of
inharmonious tendencies. This has been the theme of many stories,
and, though no doubt many of them are overdrawn, there is no
reason to doubt that they in the main depict actual experience or
are founded on close observation.</p>

<p>It is on the moral, rather than the intellectual, side of the mind
that the disharmony seems to make itself felt most strongly; and
the moral detachment of the cross-bred from the moral traditions
of both the parent stocks is possibly due in part to a certain lack
of innate compatibility with those traditions, as well as to social
ostracism; the cross-bred can assimilate neither tradition so easily
and completely as the pure-bred stocks.</p>

<p>It is possible, though this is a still more speculative view, that
the same is true of the intellectual constitution of the mind.</p>

<p>The superiority of subraces formed by the blending of allied
stocks seems to fall principally under two heads: (1) a general vigour
of constitution; (2) a greater variety and variability of innate mental
qualities. The greater variability of qualities of a subrace renders
that race more adaptable to changing conditions; for racial adaptability
depends upon the occurrence of abundant spontaneous
variations. A large variety of innate qualities renders a race capable
of progressing rapidly in civilisation; it renders it more capable both
of producing novel ideas and of appreciating and assimilating the
ideas, discoveries, and institutions of other peoples; and such
imitative assimilation from one people to another has been a main
condition of the progress of culture.</p>

<p>It is, of course, well recognised that the great centres of development
of culture have been the places where different peoples have
come most freely into contact, notably the centre of the old world
where Asia, Africa, and Europe meet together. This was the area in
which the three great races of Europe came first into contact and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
mingled freely. Some authors attribute the fertilising influence upon
culture wholly to the blending or contact of cultures; but there is
good reason to believe that it is largely due also to race-blending.</p>

<p>We might compare in this respect the three great culture
areas of the old world&mdash;Europe, India and China. The Chinese
afford an instance of one relatively pure race occupying a very
large area. In spite of its early start and great mental capacities,
its culture has stagnated. The stock was perhaps too pure.
India on the other hand seems to owe its peculiar history largely
to the fact that its population in almost all parts has been made up
from very widely different races&mdash;white, yellow and black; the
heterogeneity has been too great for stability and continued progress.
In Europe different branches and sub-branches of the white race,
that is of stocks not too widely different in constitution, have
undergone repeated crossing and recrossing.</p>

<p>It is worth while to point out that, if our generalisation is valid,
it follows that race-blending has been an important factor in the
progress of civilisation. And the generalisation has also an important
bearing upon one of the most urgent problems confronting
the statesmen of the world at the present time, and not only the
statesmen but all the citizens of the civilised states, especially the
citizens of the British Empire and of America. For it justifies
abundantly the refusal of the white inhabitants of various countries
to admit immigrants of the yellow or negro race to settle among
them; and it justifies, and more than justifies, the objection to intermarriage
with those other races which Englishmen have upheld
wherever they have settled, and which most other peoples have
not upheld<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>In all the currents of heated discussion as to the rights and
wrongs of the treatment of other races, this question of the kind of
subrace which will result from intermarriage is generally left in the
background; whereas its importance is far greater than that of all
other considerations taken together. Some, like Sir S. Olivier<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
content to approve race-blending on the ground that it improves
the inferior race. But the racial qualities of the leading peoples of
the world are too precious to be squandered in the process of improving
in some uncertain degree the quality of the overwhelming
mass of humanity of inferior stocks; the process would probably
result in the total destruction of all that humanity has striven and
suffered for in its nobler efforts.</p>

<p>It is an interesting question&mdash;When two races or subraces are
crossed, do they ever produce a homogeneous and true subrace,
exhibiting a true and stable blend of the qualities of the parental
stocks? Or does the blend always remain imperfect, with many
individuals in whom the qualities of one or other of the parental
stocks predominate? The answer seems to be that a stable subrace
may be formed in this way, though usually not until free intermarriage
has gone on for many generations. According to the most
recent doctrine of heredity, the Mendelian, every human being is a
mosaic or patchwork of unit qualities, organs, or capacities, each of
which is inherited wholly from one of the parents and not at all
from the other. If this view is well founded, it follows that there
can be no true blending of these unit qualities. But still the mosaic
may be so finely grained and the unit qualities derived from the two
parents so closely interwoven, that each individual may present an
intimate mixture of the parental qualities, may represent for all
practical purposes a blending of the two stocks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h4>RACIAL CHANGES DURING THE HISTORIC PERIOD</h4>

<p>We have found reason to believe that national character, as expressed
in the collective mental life of any people, is only to be understood
and explained when we take into account the native or racial mental
qualities of the people; and we have seen reason to think that
these racial qualities were in the main formed in the prehistoric or
race-making period; we have noted some of the principal attempts
to throw light on the prehistoric moulding of races. But these
racial qualities, although very persistent, are not unalterable. We
must, therefore, consider whether, and in what ways, the racial mental
qualities of a people may have been changed during the nation-making
or historic period. What are the factors which determine
such changes? What is their influence on the destiny of nations?</p>

<p>The most diverse opinions are still held in regard to the question
of the extent and nature of changes of innate mental qualities of
peoples during the historic period, the period during which a people,
or a branch of a people, attains political unity and becomes a nation.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the moulding power of physical environment
tends to become greatly diminished during this more
settled period of the life of a people, and that, in so far as changes
take place, they are determined principally by racial substitutions
and by social selections within a people, rather than by the mere
struggle for survival of individuals or of family groups against the
inclemency of nature or against other individuals and groups.</p>

<p>The former of these two modes of change, substitution, has
undoubtedly been effected on a large scale, producing in certain instances
radical changes in the racial quality of the populations of
some countries; that is to say, there has been more or less gradual
substitution of one race for another, while the nation as a geographical
and political entity, with its language and much of its
laws, institutions, and customs, lives on without complete breach
of continuity, and the people, although by blood radically changed,
continues to regard itself as the same people, accepting as its own
the traditions of those predecessors whom they mistakenly regard
as their ancestors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking and complete change of this sort
in European history was the change of racial character of the
Greek people. It is now pretty well established that the Greek
population of the classical age was an incomplete blend of two of
the three great European stocks, namely <i>Homo Europaeus</i>, the
northern, fair, long-headed type of tall stature, and of <i>H. Mediterraneus</i>,
the short dark long-headed type of the Mediterranean coast
lands. The Pelasgians, who, as we now know, had achieved a
civilisation of a type that was widely spread through southern
Europe as long as three thousand years or more before our era,
seem to have been of this Mediterranean race.</p>

<p>Rather more than a thousand years before our era, the Pelasgian
population of Greece and the neighbouring regions began to be
overrun and conquered by tribes of the fair Northern race which
came in successive invasions, the Thracians, the Hellenes, the
Achaeans, the Ionians, and later the Dorians. Just as, at a later
period, men of the Northern race established themselves as a military
aristocracy over the Celtic peoples of western Europe, so these invading
tribes established themselves as a military aristocracy over
the populations of Mediterranean race; and, as in the former case, so
here, they intermarried largely with the people they conquered and
formed an imperfectly blended population, in the upper social strata
of which the fair type was predominant, in the lower strata the
dark type.</p>

<p>From this happy blending of two races was formed the people
which, under the favourable geographical and social conditions
of that time and place, evolved the civilisation that culminated
after six hundred years in the Athenian culture of the time of
Pericles. And then, after a very short time, the whole of that
splendid civilisation faded away, and the Greek people sank to a
position of slight importance from which it has never again risen.
After having displayed in several departments of the intellectual life
a power and originality such as have never been approached by any
other people, they became a people of very mediocre capacities,
devoid of power of origination and purely imitative.</p>

<p>That this profound change in the mental qualities of the population
of Greece was due to substitution of one racial stock by an
inferior one is beyond question. That a great change of racial type
was effected is sufficiently proved by the comparison of the physical
type of the modern with that of the ancient Greeks. The modern
are predominantly dark and round headed; the ancient were distinctly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
long headed, as shown by a sufficient number of skull
measurements; and they were, as regards the dominant class at
least, predominantly fair in colour. It has been supposed that the
many references to the fair hair and complexion of heroes and gods
were due to fair persons being very rare and hence an object of
special admiration; but there is no ground for this. The way in which
this racial substitution took place is also pretty clear; and the rapid,
almost sudden, decline of the intellectual productivity of the Greek
people coincided in time with the racial change.</p>

<p>The first and most important factor in the extermination of
the best blood of ancient Greece was military selection. Military
group selection in the prehistoric period had, no doubt, played a
great part in bringing about the evolution of the superior mental
qualities of the European peoples, especially of the fair northern
race. So long as the peoples consisted of more or less wandering
tribes of pure race, which waged a war of extermination upon one
another, the peoples and tribes of superior mental and moral endowments
must in the main have survived, while those of inferior
endowments went under. But, so soon as the Nordic tribes became
settled as aristocracies ruling over the Pelasgian populations, the
effects of military selection tended to be reversed; instead of making
for racial improvement, they made for deterioration. That racial
deterioration occurs under these conditions seems to be an almost
general law; it has been exemplified among many different peoples.
The many small Greek states were almost perpetually at war with
one another; and the result of the warfare was not so much the
wholesale extermination of the people of any one state, as the killing
off in large numbers of the younger men of the ruling caste, the free
citizens of whom the armies were almost entirely composed.</p>

<p>The wars between Sparta and Athens were the most destructive
and tragic of all in this respect. We know that the numbers of
Spartans of the aristocratic class, never very large, became fewer
and fewer, in spite of efforts made to keep up the number by admitting
to citizenship persons not of pure Spartan blood; and that
Sparta was eventually destroyed simply for lack of men, men of
the ruling class<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p>In Athens and other states the depleting agencies were more
numerous. Frequent wars played the same part as in Sparta; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the number of free men was further diminished by the repeated
founding of colonies, in which a relatively small number of persons
of Greek blood became swallowed up in a large population of
mixed and inferior origin. In some states, in Athens especially, the
political conditions worked powerfully in the same direction.
Prominent citizens were perpetually exiled or condemned to death,
sometimes in considerable batches. It is said that at certain times
two-thirds of the citizens of certain states were living in exile; and
the exiles, going to the colonies or other foreign lands, were for
the most part lost to the Greek people.</p>

<p>Then, with the blooming period of Greek intellect, came the loss
of the ancient religious beliefs, beliefs which had strengthened the
family and made each man anxious to have many sons that the
rites might be duly performed for the repose of his shade. Coinciding
with this was the great increase of luxury which made large families
too expensive, save for the most wealthy; while at the same time
the abundance of slave labour kept down the rate of remuneration
of all handicrafts, and so condemned the class of free Greek artisans
to a state bordering on poverty. Hence, the free citizens of pure
blood, already largely reduced in numbers, ceased to multiply; and
the number of the citizens was only sustained by the admission to
citizenship of foreigners, freed slaves, and various elements of
different and inferior racial origins.</p>

<p>Hence, at the time that the battle of Chersonese was fought and
the Macedonians attained the supremacy, the Greek citizens were
no longer the same racial aristocracy which had produced the finest
flowers of Greek culture. But the work of substitution was still only
partially accomplished. In the time of the Roman domination of
Greece, the remnants of the true Greek aristocracy were removed
by the slave trade. Tens of thousands of Greeks of all classes were
brought together to the slave markets; while those men of talent
who escaped that fate emigrated to Rome to seek their fortunes by
teaching the Greek language and art and philosophy. Later still
came the Goths, who sacked the towns and destroyed or drove out
the inhabitants. Then followed successive invasions of Slavs from
the north; and lastly, the domination of the Turk well-nigh completed
the extinction of the old aristocracy.</p>

<p>The modern Greek people is descended largely from Slav invaders
and largely from the numerous and prolific slave population of the
great age of Greece, but hardly at all from the men who made the
greatness of that age.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the change and deterioration of the racial mental
qualities of the Greek people by racial substitution is the most
striking example in history, it is by no means the only one<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.</p>

<p>The substitution in that case was largely by elements drawn
from other regions and peoples. But a similar substitution and consequent
change of innate mental qualities may go on slowly within
any people which has been formed, as have almost all the present
European nations, by an incomplete blending of two or more racial
stocks; it may be effected by internal selection without any introduction
of new elements from any other region. Before considering
an example of the process, let us note certain facts which show that
there may well have taken place, throughout the historic period,
changes of the composition of peoples by internal substitution or
changes of the mental constitution by internal selections&mdash;that is
to say, by the more rapid multiplication of certain mental types and
the relative infertility of other types. Consider first the striking
fact that the populations of the various European countries seem
for the most part to have remained almost stationary as regards
numbers, or even in some cases to have diminished greatly in
numbers, throughout the period between the Roman domination
and the later part of the eighteenth century. The population of
Spain is said to have declined from forty millions under the Roman
rule to only six millions in the year 1700 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> The population of
Great Britain is said to have increased from five millions to six
millions only during the seventeenth century; and it is certain that
in the main it had increased at an even slower rate, or not at all, in
the preceding centuries since the Norman Conquest; whereas in the
nineteenth century it increased from thirteen millions to nearly
forty millions; that is to say, it trebled itself in the century; and
even that rate of increase is considerably less than the possible
maximal rate.</p>

<p>The same is roughly true for most of the European countries;
their populations, throughout great stretches of the historic period,
remained stationary or increased only very slowly. Now when,
during any period, a population does not multiply at the maximal
physiological rate, changes of its character may well be taking place;
for, in proportion as the rate of increase falls below the maximal,
there is a lack of fertility in the population or in some part of it;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
if this relative infertility affects equally all parts and classes of the
population, it will produce no change of its composition; but if it
is selective, if for any reason it affects one class, or persons of some
one kind of temperament or mental type, more than others, then
this class or this temperament or this form of ability tends rapidly
to diminish and to disappear from among that people.</p>

<p>The causes of the relative infertility may be divided into two
classes: (1) those which operate by killing persons before they have
completed their middle life; (2) those which restrict fertility without
killing. Both may be selective in their action. The former kind is
alone operative in determining evolution in the animal world and
probably also among the less civilised peoples; but, as civilisation
advances, the causes of infertility of the other kind increase constantly
in effectiveness, while the former operate with less and less
intensity. It is through the causes which diminish fertility merely,
rather than exterminate individuals, that changes of racial quality
of nations are now being, and in the future will be, principally
determined. Selection of this kind is usually distinguished from the
various modes of natural selection which work by extermination,
by the name &#8216;reproductive selection.&#8217; Briefly, natural selection
operates by means of selective death rate, reproductive selection
by means of selective birth rate.</p>

<p>No doubt, disease, especially in the form of plagues and epidemics,
was one of the principal causes of the slowness of increase
of population throughout the Middle Ages. And this was probably
non-selective as regards mental qualities, although it was strongly
selective as regards power of resistance to disease, and has left the
European peoples more resistant to most diseases than any other
peoples, save perhaps the Chinese<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

<p>But many other causes of selection were at work. Disease presumably
has not affected mental qualities by selection; although by
direct action and mental discouragement it may have tended to
the decay of civilisations; it has been argued, for example, that
malaria played a great part in the decay of classical antiquity, that
it was introduced some centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and enfeebled the population
of Greece and Italy.</p>

<p>More interesting, from our point of view of the influences affecting
the mental constitution of populations, is the effect of alcohol.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Dr Archdall Reid has argued very forcibly that resistance to the
attraction of alcohol is a mental peculiarity which a race only
acquires through long exposure to the influence of abundant alcohol;
that populations are resistant just in proportion to their past
exposure to it&mdash;as is true in the main of epidemic and endemic
diseases&mdash;and that in both cases this is due to selection.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Much careful painstaking work by continental anthropologists
seems to have proved that a change of racial composition through
internal selection has been and still is going on in both the German
and French people. The facts have been worked out by O. Ammon<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>,
Hensen and De Lapouge<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. They show, chiefly by means of the
comparison of the forms of large numbers of skulls, that throughout
the historic period the French and German peoples have been
becoming more and more round headed, that the type of <i>Homo
Alpinus</i>, the short dark round-headed race, has been gaining upon
the type of <i>Homo Europaeus</i>.</p>

<p>We have seen that the latter stock of the fair northern type
constituted the upper class among the Gauls of Caesar&#8217;s time; and
the invasions of Franks and Normans must have added considerably
to their numbers; yet, in spite of that, the mental and physical
characters of this race are said by these authors to be now very
much rarer than formerly, owing to the internal selections which
have favoured the Alpine type. These took the following forms.
In the first place, in the early Middle Ages, it is said, the Nordic
type, being a military aristocracy, suffered, as in ancient Greece,
proportionally far greater losses in warfare than the Alpine type.
Secondly, the severe persecutions of Protestants in France drove
into exile, besides killing many others, large numbers who were
for the most part of the fair race, because, as we have seen, this
race does not easily remain content within the Roman Church. It
is said, for example, that, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
so large a number of Protestants passed into Prussia that the rise
of Prussia as a powerful State was the immediate consequence,
with of course an equivalent loss to France. De Lapouge considers
this the greatest blow that France has suffered in the historic period.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Normandy alone, it is reported, sent 200,000 Protestants to Prussia.
But the most important and curious factor has been, according to
De Lapouge, what he calls the selection by towns. He shows, by
comparison of masses of anthropological observations, that the
Nordic type has been predominantly attracted to the towns (which
fact he attributes to their more restless enterprising character) while
the dark type has been more content to lead the quiet agricultural
life<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. He points out that the town-life stimulates to a new struggle
for adaptation, from which differentiation of classes results; the longheads
maintain their numbers better and rise in the social scale.
Further, he shows that town-life makes against fertility, owing to a
number of psychological influences&mdash;the stimulation of ambition
and of the intellect, the luxurious habits, the weakening of family
life, the break with the past and its family traditions, the uncertainty
of the future, the weakening of religious sanctions; and he gives
reason to believe that in this way the towns have been, through
many generations, weeding out the elements of the fair race and
determining an ever increasing predominance of <i>Homo Alpinus</i>.</p>

<p>In order to understand the importance of these internal selections,
it is necessary to realise that their effects are cumulative
in a high degree, when the same influences continue to work
through many generations. Thus, if within any people there are
two equally numerous classes of persons of different mental constitution,
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and if these constitutions determine that the one
group <i>A</i> has a net birth rate of three children per pair of adults,
while the other <i>B</i> has a birth rate of four per pair of parents; then,
in the third generation after one century, the numbers of the two
classes, other things being the same for both, will be as ten to
sixteen. After two centuries the one class will be more than twice
as numerous as the other; and after three centuries the numbers of
the class <i>A</i> will constitute about fifteen per cent, only of the whole
population. Late marriage is also very important. Suppose that
of two classes, <i>A</i> marries at 35, and <i>B</i> at 25 years, and that each
produces four children per marriage; then (other things being the
same) after three and a half centuries <i>B</i> becomes four times as
numerous as <i>A</i>. These two factors generally work together.</p>

<p>But, apart from the change of racial composition of a heterogeneous
nation by internal selection of this sort, changes of the
constitution of even a racially homogeneous people may be produced
through selection affecting persons of particular mental tendencies.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
One of the most striking instances of this is the elimination of the
religious tendencies from the constitution of a people by negative
selection through the action of the Roman Church<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. For many
centuries the Roman Church has attracted to her service very large
numbers of those who were by nature most religiously minded, and
it has imposed celibacy upon them, it has forbidden them to transmit
their natural piety to descendants. In Protestant countries this
process of negative selection of the religious tendencies was continued
for a much briefer period than in the Catholic countries. It is maintained
with much plausibility that we may see the result in the fact
that sincere and natural piety is far commoner in the Protestant
countries than in the Roman Catholic; that in the two countries
Italy and Spain, in which the influence of the Roman Church has
been greater than in any others, the people are now the least religiously
minded of any in Europe; that with them religion has
become purely formal and external, that the mass of the people,
though outwardly conforming, is absolutely irreligious; that in fact
this form of religion tends to exterminate itself in the long run by
insisting upon that form of reproductive selection<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>Another striking instance of the incidence of negative selection
upon certain mental qualities of a people is afforded by the history
of Spain. In the sixteenth century Spain attained to a supreme
position of power and grandeur among the nations of the world,
such as has been rivalled by Rome alone in all history; and then
very rapidly her power decayed, and ever since she has remained
one of the most backward of European peoples, contributing little
to European culture, to science, art or philosophy, incapable of
developing without the aid of foreigners her rich industrial resources,
impotent in war, entirely devoid of enterprise and originality. To
what is this great change due?</p>

<p>It is not due to any adverse change of climate, to devastation
by war or plague or famine, nor is it due to any change in geographical
or economic relations. Spain remains more happily situated
as a centre of commerce than any other country of the world. The
mass of the people remains vigorous, proud, and virile. It is the
intellect of the nation alone which has decayed, or rather it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
is the intellectual life of the nation that has become utterly
stagnant.</p>

<p>Buckle drew a vivid picture of the stagnation of the Spanish intellect
and sought the explanation of it in the great power wielded by
the Roman Catholic Church, which, he said, had successfully fostered
the spirit of protection and superstition, had discouraged every effort
of the intellect, and utterly repressed the spirit of inquiry, to the
free activity of which all progress of civilisation was, in his opinion,
due. Here, again, modern science shows that Buckle was led into
error by his ignorance of the importance of the biological factors,
the racial qualities and the changes produced in them by selection.</p>

<p>Galton and, still more fully, Fouill&eacute;e have shown that the
stagnation of the intellect of the Spanish people and the consequent
decay of the power and glory of Spain have been chiefly due to the
fact that the people of Spain ceased to produce those men of exceptional
mental endowments, of intellectual energy and enterprise and
independence of character, on whom primarily depend the power
and prosperity of any nation and who are the most essential factors
in the progress of the civilisation of any people, who in short are
essential for the growth and endurance of national mind and character.
And this was because during some centuries intellectual
power, enterprise, and energy were steadily weeded out by a rigorous
process of negative selection. In the first place, the Church, having
attained enormous power, became in two ways a tremendous agency
of negative selection. First, she made celibate priests of a very
large proportion of all those whose natural bent was towards the
things of the mind, multiplying monastic orders excessively. Secondly,
by means of the Inquisition she destroyed with fire and sword or
drove into exile through many generations all those who would not
conform to her narrow creed, who combined intellectual power with
independence and originality of spirit and a firm will. In addition
she drove out all the Jews and all of Moorish origin.</p>

<p>The second mode of negative selection, namely persecution
exerted by the Church, was no doubt the more important, but
the former also must have had a great effect. We are helped to
realize the probable magnitude of the effect by reflection on facts
set out in an article by Bishop Welldon<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. He shows the great part
played in English civilisation since the reformation by the sons
of the English Clergy; including as they did a number of men of
the highest achievements in all departments of our national life.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
If all those sons of clergy who have shown exceptional abilities, and
all their descendants, had by the rule of celibacy been prevented
from coming into existence, how disastrous would that have been
for the English people, how much less successful and vigorous would
the nation have become!</p>

<p>A second powerful agency of negative selection was the immense
colonial empire which Spain so rapidly acquired, especially her
American conquests. The whole people was seized with the desire
to enrich themselves with the gold of the New World, and was
fascinated by the idea of imitating the romantic adventures of
Cortes and Pizarro. Great numbers of the bolder and most capable
spirits set out for the New World, and there either lost their lives
or remained to mix their blood with that of the native Indians or
the imported negroes. In either case their stock was lost to the
mother country.</p>

<p>The third and culminating cause was the career of military
aggression pursued by Charles V; this completed the extermination
of the aristocracy of ability and finally plunged Spain into an intellectual
torpor which has persisted ever since and from which she
can only be raised up by a succession of men of first-rate intellect
and character: men such as she seems incapable of producing,
because her people has thus been drained of all its most valuable
elements, because her eugenic stocks have been exterminated.</p>

<p>The fall of Spain illustrates not only the operation of internal
social selection affecting certain mental qualities; it illustrates also
once more, even more clearly than the fall of Greece, the fact that
the civilisation of a people and its power and position in the world
depend altogether upon its intellectual aristocracy, and that the fall
of a people from a high place necessarily follows the failure to continue
to produce such an aristocracy.</p>

<p>In the civilised nations of the modern world, the most important
kind of selection at work at the present time is what is distinguished
as &#8216;economic selection&#8217; working in conjunction with the formation
of the social classes. It has no doubt operated at various times
among other civilised peoples, but never so strongly and universally
as at present.</p>

<p>All the leading civilised nations have passed, in the eighteenth
and earlier part of the nineteenth centuries, through a period in
which the discoveries of science have enormously increased the
productive powers of man and man&#8217;s control over, and power of resistance
to, the forces of nature. The result has been that everywhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
civilised populations have multiplied at a great rate, in a way that
has never before occurred. But now this period seems to have
definitely come to an end, and to have been succeeded by a new
period characterised by three features which threaten to exert a
most deleterious effect upon the innate mental qualities of peoples.</p>

<p>(1) The world is becoming filled up; the untouched wealth of
enormous territories no longer lies open to the grasp of the bold
and enterprising. The coloured races are entering into the economic
competition in the way foreshadowed by the late C. H. Pearson<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.
The high organisation of every form of economic activity renders
the competition for wealth everywhere extremely severe. And at
the same time men have come to regard as necessities of life what,
but a few generations ago, were the luxuries of the wealthy or
unknown even to them; that is to say, the standard of comfort has
risen greatly. The combined result of these changes is the increased
difficulty of maintaining a family in the upper strata of society.</p>

<p>(2) There has been a great development of humanitarian sentiment,
one result of which has been the breaking down of class-barriers
and the perfecting of the social ladder; at the same time
it has produced such changes of our laws and institutions as tend
in an ever increasing degree to lighten the economic burdens of the
poor and to consummate by social organisation the abolition of
natural selection; that is to say, these changes are putting a stop
to the repression by natural laws of the multiplication of the less
fit, those least well endowed mentally and physically. The recent
great decline of infant mortality is one evidence of this.</p>

<p>(3) The influence of religion and custom has weakened, and men
are more disposed to adopt the naturalistic point of view, to believe
that this life is not a mere preparation for an infinitely longer life elsewhere,
but that it is all they can certainly reckon upon and, therefore,
is to be made the most of; while at the same time they are oppressed
by the severity of the economic competition and by a sense of the
lack of any ultimate purpose, end, or sanction of human effort.</p>

<p>The combined result of these three changes is a strong tendency
to reverse the operation by which nature has secured the evolution
of higher types of mind&mdash;namely, by breeding in the main from the
higher types in each generation. We see a tendency for the population
to be renewed in each generation preponderantly from the mentally
inferior elements, those whose outlook hardly extends beyond the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
immediate future and who have not learnt to demand for themselves
and their children favoured positions in the great game of life. The
effects of these three changes operate in the following manner. The
rate of reproduction, the birth rate, of nearly all civilised countries
is falling rapidly (although the death rate also falls). This diminution
of rate of reproduction is due to increase of celibacy, abstention from
marriage, to increase of late marriage, and to voluntary restriction
of the number of the family in marriage.</p>

<p>Now, it is shown statistically that this falling off of fertility
chiefly affects the classes above the average of ability, the upper
and middle classes and also the superior part of the artisan classes<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.
These classes have been formed and are maintained by the operation
of social and economic competition; they have long been, and are
still, perpetually recruited in each generation from the lower strata,
by the rise into them of the abler members of the lower strata.
Hence, economic selection, under our present social system, seems to
be working strongly for the mental deterioration of the most highly
civilised peoples; the social ladder, becoming more nearly perfect,
perpetually drains the mass of a people of its best members, enabling
them to rise to the upper strata where they tend to become infertile<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.
Galton and Prof. Karl Pearson have insisted most strongly upon
these tendencies. But they have not escaped the notice of continental
authors. M. Jacobi<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> has written a large volume packed with
historical illustrations to prove inductively the law that aristocracies
always die out, or are only maintained by constant recruiting from
below, or in other words that aristocracies tend to become infertile.
And the modern tendency which we have just now considered under
the head of economic selection may be regarded as falling under the
head of this law, a case of the extension of the law to democratic
communities and the natural aristocracies of ability which are
generated in them.</p>

<p>We may perhaps state the principal causes of this tendency
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
in general terms as follows: the acquirement by any class of
leisure, culture, and the habit of reflection (the malady of thought)
partially emancipates that class from the empire of instinct, custom,
and the religious sanctions of morality; and these are the great
conservative agencies under the influence of which men not so
emancipated continue to multiply according to the law of nature.
These instincts, customs, and religious sanctions of morality, which
lead men to multiply freely, have been acquired for the good of the
race or of the society considered as an organism whose life is of
indefinitely long duration; and in some respects they are opposed
to the pleasure and welfare of the individual life. The habit
of reason and reflection tends to lead men to act for their own
immediate welfare, rather than for the future welfare of the race
or of society, and to refuse to make those sacrifices of ease and
to undertake those responsibilities and efforts which the care of a
family imposes and which alone can secure the welfare of the future
generations. It is in respect to these duties that the great antagonism
between religion and reason appears in its most significant aspect.</p>

<p>The tendency for the upper classes to die out and to be replaced
constantly from the lower social strata by the aid of the social
ladder is no doubt stronger now than in foregoing ages. But
it has always been operative; and this is widely recognised; while
the comfortable inference has often been drawn that the process
is not only inevitable but actually beneficial and desirable. It is
said that the upper classes inevitably become effete, and that the
lower constitute an inexhaustible reservoir of mental and moral
excellences, from which they are and can be indefinitely renewed;
and thus the population is always rising in the social scale, a state
of affairs which makes for social happiness.</p>

<p>But, if we take a longer view, the prospect is not so comforting;
it seems only too probable that this constant dying away of society
at the top and the renewal of the upper strata from the lower, by
the agency of the social ladder, must sooner or later result in a
serious deterioration of the lower strata, at least in draining it of
its best stocks. There is also a return or downward current of less
strength, which returns to the lower strata the failures, the incompetents,
and the degenerates of the upper. And these two currents
must, it would seem, in the course of ages render it impossible for
the lower strata to continue to supply the superior elements required
to maintain the upper. If and when that stage is reached, national
decay must set in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>In England, where the operation of the social ladder has been
more effective and of longer duration than in any other country, there
are indications that this stage is at hand. Our social ladder has
provided and still provides a splendid array of talent, but already
it has produced, as its complement, a large mass of very inefficient
population. Foreign observers are constantly impressed with this;
Mr Collier Price<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, for example, tells us that the million best of our
population is the finest in the world; but that our lowest stratum
is the most degraded and hopelessly inefficient.</p>

<p>Looking at the course of history widely, we may see, then, in the
differentiation of social classes by the social ladder and in the
tendency of the upper strata to fail to reproduce themselves, an explanation
of the cyclic course of civilisation. This has been ascribed by
some authors<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> to race-crossing, followed by blending, and ultimately
by stagnation consequent upon complete blending and the flowering
period which coincides with it. But we now have a more adequate
explanation of the decay which follows upon the blooming period.
It is not mere stagnation, resulting from the achievement of social
harmony and the relaxation of efforts at social adaptation and
achievement of all kinds. The decline is probably due as much, and
perhaps in a much higher degree, to the exhaustion of the mass of
the population, the completion of the draining process by which,
throughout the whole period of the development of the cycle of
civilisation, the best elements and strains have been drained off
from the lower strata, brought to the top, and strained off.</p>

<p>It is interesting to speculate on the possible effect on this process
of the fact that we are becoming more clearly conscious of these
tendencies and subjecting them to scientific inquiry. Already the
legislature has taken one small step of a eugenic nature and is
soon to take another. The important thing is that we should recognise
that men are not the helpless sport of blind forces, that mankind
can control its own destiny in ever increasing degree as knowledge
grows.</p>

<p>A word may be said in regard to sexual selection, which probably
played a part in the evolution of the mental capacities of men.
It would seem that, in the peoples among whom monogamy is the
rule, it no longer operates to any appreciable degree. With the
general excess of females, we could suppose that it still tended to
race improvement only if the unmarried women were on the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
distinctly inferior to the married. But, if there is any difference, it
is probably the other way; because the most able women are more
and more attracted into independent careers. The further the so-called
emancipation of women goes, the more will this be the case.</p>

<p>Civilisation, then, tends from the first to put an end to that
elimination of the less fit individuals by the severities of Nature
which we call natural selection; and, as soon as it has passed beyond
its earliest stages, it brings to an end also the mortal conflicts of
social groups and the consequent group selection, which was in all
probability a main factor of racial progress in the prehistoric period.
It abolishes also at an early stage the improving influence of sexual
selection, which was probably the third principal condition of the
development of the higher powers of mankind.</p>

<p>Civilisation replaces these modes of selection, which make for
improvement of the racial qualities of peoples, by a number of modes
of social selection, nearly all of which must have been, so far as we
can see, negative or reversed selections&mdash;that is, selections making
for deterioration of the mental qualities of the civilised peoples.
In place of natural selection, group selection, and sexual selection, we
have had at work, within each people in increasing degrees, various
forms of social selection&mdash;military selection, selection by the towns,
selection by the church, political selection with its exiles and its
colonial system, and lastly economic selection, which has become
exceedingly influential in recent years among ourselves. And all
these, so far as can be seen, have operated mainly, among some
peoples and in some ages very powerfully, to diminish the fertility
of the best elements of the population and so to produce actual
retrogression of the average intellectual capacity of peoples, and
especially to deprive them of eugenic stocks, the stocks which
were most fertile in individuals of exceptional capacity on whom
the progress of civilisation and the relative power of nations chiefly
depend.</p>

<p>M. de Lapouge&#8217;s investigations of the matter have led him to
a very melancholy conclusion. He attaches especial importance to
urban selection, as he calls it, in weeding out the best stocks. He
writes&mdash;&#8220;There is no more agonising question than that of the
exhaustion of our intellectual reserves by the influence of city-life.
The public and our statesmen do not suspect it. But nevertheless
it is the great danger of modern societies and especially of France.
Of all the devastating influences which we have called social selections,
selection by the town makes most powerfully for deterioration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of peoples. Our towns are destroying all of the intelligent and
energetic that have been spared us by the long centuries of disastrous
selections. France has lost in the past almost all her dolicho-blond
elements, and now are disappearing those of mixed stock and the
best of the short-headed type. In all the continent of Europe the
hour is at hand when there will remain only the inert and used up
d&eacute;bris of our dead nations, pitiable remnants who will be the prey
of unknown conquerors. Thus perished the Hellenic world, thus will
perish the whole of our civilisation, if man does not make application
of his knowledge of the principles of heredity, that tremendous
power which to-day is bringing death and stagnation, but by the
control of which science will enable us to secure safety and national
vigour<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is possible that this conclusion gives too dark a picture of the
tendencies of social selection in the civilised nations; but it does
seem probable that with the advance of civilisation the tendency
to reversed selection becomes strong<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. We are at any rate compelled
to conclude that it is impossible to discover evidence of any influences
that can have made at all strongly for progressive evolution of
intellectual capacity during the historic period; whereas a number
of forms of selection seem to have worked against it and must at
least have counterbalanced any factors making for improvement,
and that therefore no advance has taken place in intellectual capacity
but more probably some deterioration has already occurred.</p>

<p>The conclusion thus reached deductively is well borne out by
the small amount of inductive evidence that is available. Such
comparison as we can make between the leading modern nations
and the civilised nations of antiquity tends rather to show that both
as regards the average man, and as regards the intellectual endowment
of exceptional men and the proportion of such men produced,
the advantage lies with the ancient peoples. And the comparison
of skull capacity or size of brain decidedly supports this conclusion.
It has been found by a number of anthropologists that the average
skull capacity of men of the late Stone Age in Europe was equal to,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
or greater than, that of modern Europeans. And in the main, on
the large average, intellectual capacity varies with the size of the
brain.</p>

<p>Our seeming intellectual superiority is a superiority of the traditional
store of intellectual gains, a superiority of knowledge and of
the instruments of the intellect, of language, and of the methods
of mental operation by which knowledge is obtained, especially the
mathematical and scientific methods in general<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. Consider a single
example frequently quoted to show the intellectual inferiority of
the modern savage. It is said&mdash;Here is a poor savage who cannot
count above ten without the help of his fingers and toes or other
tallies; and we generally forget that we also should be incapable of
counting above ten, had not our ancestors slowly devised the system
of enumeration or verbal counting, and that, given such a system,
the poor savage would be able to count as well as any of us.</p>

<p>The reader may be prepared to accept this conclusion as regards
the intellectual capacities of mankind, and yet may be inclined to
say&mdash;Surely the civilised peoples have progressed as regards their
moral qualities throughout the historic period! Let us, therefore,
consider this point separately for a moment.</p>

<p>Is there reason to believe that there has been progress of the
innate moral disposition during the historic period? Here we are on
still more difficult ground than when we considered the question of
the progress of innate intellectual capacity.</p>

<p>The essence of the higher morality is the predominance of the
altruistic motives over the egoistic, in the deliberately reasoned
control of conduct. But morality in this sense is relatively rare in
every age, and the great mass of moral conduct of men in general
is the issue of mental processes of a simpler kind; it consists in doing
what one believes to be right, in acting according to what one
believes to be one&#8217;s duty; no matter how that belief may have been
arrived at. The tendency to do what one believes to be right, which
for the vast majority of men has always been simply the tendency
to conform to the code of morals accepted by his society, has an
innate basis which may properly be called the social or moral
disposition. At present I am not concerned to define the elements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of our nature which make up the moral disposition<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. The morality
of a people, objectively considered, is the outcome of the interaction
between their moral disposition, on the one hand, and the moral
environment of the individuals, on the other; and the latter consists
of two parts: (1) the traditional system of precepts, customs, laws,
in short the code: (2) the traditional system of sanctions by which
the code is upheld and enforced.</p>

<p>If we compare, in respect to this moral nature, the members of
primitive societies with those of highly civilised societies, applying
simply the criterion of conformity of conduct to the accepted code,
we shall be impelled to the conclusion that the former, the savages
and barbarians, have in general the moral nature much more highly
developed than the members of civilised societies; for they conform
on the whole very much more strictly to their moral codes. But
such a conclusion would be hardly fair to the civilised peoples; first,
because their social environment is more complex, so that the
bearing of their moral code is less simple and direct; it is less
easily obeyed, because its teachings are more generalised in form
and do not provide clear irresistible rulings for all or any large
proportion of the much greater variety of situations with which
individuals find themselves confronted. Secondly, because the code
is a higher one and makes greater demands upon the self-control of
individuals. Thirdly, because not only is the code less clear and
direct, but also the sanctions of conduct, civil and religious, are
generally less obvious and immediate; and the effectiveness of both
code and sanctions is weakened by the co-existence, within complex
civilised societies, of more or less rival codes and systems of sanctions,
which inevitably weaken the authority of one another; whereas the
code and sanctions of the savage or barbarous society reign absolutely
and without rivalry, so that men are not led to question their
authority.</p>

<p>The conditions of moral conduct are, then, so different as to
forbid any attempt to compare the innate moral dispositions of
primitive and civilised peoples; and all we can do, in order to arrive
at an opinion, is to consider whether the conditions have been such
as to favour the evolution of the moral disposition, the innate basis
of the social tendencies, during the nation-making period.</p>

<p>There can, I think, be no doubt that the principal condition of
the evolution of the moral nature was group selection among
primitive societies constantly at war with one another. In conflicts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of that kind it must have been the solidarity of each group, resting
upon the moral dispositions of individuals, the tendency of each
individual to conform to the law and moral code of the society and
to stand loyally by his leaders and comrades, which, more than
anything else, determined success and survival in the struggle of
the group for existence. At first, the nature of the code must have
been of relatively small importance; the all important condition of
survival of the group must have been the strict obedience to it on
the part of the members of the group.</p>

<p>This is not a deduction only from general principles. One may
observe the effect of tribal conflict, on comparing, in various parts
of the world, tribes that have long been subjected to its influence
with closely allied tribes that have long led a peaceful existence<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.</p>

<p>At a later stage, as the traditional codes of morality became
differentiated and more complex with the increasing complexity of
societies, the nature of these codes must have acquired an increasing
influence in determining group survival; but it must still have been
subordinate in importance to the degree of development of the moral
disposition; for a society with an inferior moral code, strictly conformed
to by its members, would in the long run have better chances
of survival than one with a higher code less strictly observed. Hence,
the higher more difficult codes could only be attained by those
peoples among whom the instinctive basis of social conduct had
become highly evolved by a long process of group selection.</p>

<p>But, on passing into the stage of settled societies of large extent,
that is to say, as peoples passed from the stage of tribal organisation
to that of national organisation, the evolution of the social disposition
through the mortal conflict of groups must have tended to
come to an end; because group selection became less active, the
conflicts between the larger and less numerous societies or groups
became rarer and also less fatal to the vanquished societies. In other
words, during the historic period failure in conflict has not usually
meant extermination; national cultures and the power and glory of
nations have come and gone, but the various peoples, the units of
conflict, have in the main survived their failures and persisted in
living. Group selection, the main condition of evolution of the
social disposition, has, therefore, been abolished; and of the various
forms of social selection operating within societies, the chief of which
we have briefly noticed, no one seems to have been of a nature to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
produce further evolution of the social disposition; all of them
must rather have operated adversely to it. Military selection,
selection by the Church&#8217;s rule of celibacy, political selection&mdash;all
these must have fallen most heavily on the individuals in whom
the social disposition was strong, whose conduct was influenced
largely by the sense of duty, and less by the individual impulses
and desires.</p>

<p>We may conclude, then, with some confidence that there has
not been further evolution of the innate moral disposition in the
historic period. This conclusion is greatly at variance with popular
conceptions; we are apt to pride ourselves upon our superior morality;
to point to our humanitarian laws and institutions, to our tenderness
for the weak, the poor, and the suffering; to our regard even for the
welfare of savage peoples, whom we no longer deliberately exterminate,
and for domestic animals; and to suppose that all this
shows modern civilised men to be innately superior in morality
to their ancestors and to the barbarous peoples. But our conclusion
that the difference implies merely an evolution of moral
tradition, not of moral nature, will appear probable if we reflect upon
the fact that a widespread change of this kind in respect to some
department of conduct has sometimes been produced within a very
short space of time, even within the lifetime of one generation. Take
the attitude of Englishmen towards slavery and the African slave
trade. It is hardly more than half a century since large numbers
of Englishmen, or men of English origin, owned great gangs
of slaves or drew their wealth from slave labour; yet now most
of us look with horror upon slavery of every kind. Take the
case of kindness to domestic animals. It is a comparatively
recent tradition; and, within the memories of those who are not
yet middle-aged, a great improvement has taken place. Again,
there are many persons who, while tender to their domestic
animals, are entirely brutal where wild animals are concerned,
since public opinion or traditional morality does not yet bear
so strongly upon our relations to them. Again, it is not long
since in our factories, our prisons, our schools, the most horrible
tortures were applied to our fellow citizens without provoking
any protest; while now we display perhaps an excessive tenderness
and have passed law after law to protect the feeble against
the strong.</p>

<p>The mental development of peoples in the historic period has,
therefore, not consisted in, nor been caused by, nor in all probability
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
has it been accompanied by, any appreciable evolution of innate
intellectual or moral capacities beyond the degrees achieved in the
race-making period, before the modern nations began to take shape.
There is no reason to think that we are intellectually or morally
superior by nature to our savage ancestors. Such superiority of
morals and intellectual power as we enjoy has resulted from the
improvement and extension of the intellectual and moral traditions
and the accompanying evolution of social organisation.</p>

<p>A different conclusion was reached by the late Benjamin Kidd
in his <i>Social Evolution</i>, which has enjoyed a very wide circulation<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>,
and it seems worth while therefore to examine very briefly
the author&#8217;s position. Mr Kidd saw clearly and argued convincingly
that the innate intellectual capacities have not improved during the
historic period; but he held that the innate moral tendencies have
been greatly improved during this period; or rather he distinguished
between the innate moral tendencies and the innate religious tendencies;
and, while rejecting Herbert Spencer&#8217;s view that the moral
tendencies (as thus arbitrarily distinguished from the religious tendencies)
are slowly becoming improved and strengthened in the
civilised peoples, he held that the innate religious tendencies are
being greatly improved and strengthened; and he regarded this as
the underlying condition of all &#8216;social evolution.&#8217; In support of his
view he cited an impressive array of facts illustrating the general
softening of manners and morals among the civilised peoples,
especially the legislative changes which have given political power
to the masses of the people. That these evidences of a general
softening of manners and a great extension of social sympathy are
very striking we must all agree; but Kidd advanced no serious
argument in favour of his contention that these changes have been due
to some change or improvement of the innate qualities of the peoples
among whom they have appeared. And he did not suggest any
way in which this alleged improvement or accentuation of the
innate religious tendencies may have been brought about. He
attributed it wholly to the influence of the Christian religion. Now,
if Kidd had accepted the Lamarckian principle of the transmission
of acquired tendencies or effects of use and habit, he might reasonably
have attributed the alleged improvement to such influence. But he
sternly rejected that principle and proclaimed himself a rigid exponent
of the Neo-Darwinian school, which attributes all racial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
changes to selection. He even assumed the truth of the doctrine that,
in the absence of selective processes making for its improvement,
every race must inevitably degenerate. It might, then, have been
expected that he would have attempted to show how Christianity
can be supposed to have favoured the improvement by selection
of the innate religious tendencies. Yet he made no attempt in this
direction. He seems to have been aware that his view encounters
a great difficulty in the fact that Christianity powerfully swayed
the peoples of Europe for many centuries during which little or
no progress in civilisation was effected, whereas rapid and accelerating
progress of many kinds has marked the last three centuries.
He sought to meet this difficulty by attributing the rapid
progress of recent centuries to the influence of the Protestant form
of Christianity, alleging that it promotes the evolution of the
religious tendencies more powerfully than other forms. Yet this
view of the matter, even if it were acceptable, would leave the
Reformation itself quite unexplained. Kidd seems to hint that,
throughout the earlier centuries of the dominance of the Christian
religion in Europe, it was slowly effecting the alleged improvement
of the religious tendencies in the mass of the people, without these
being able to manifest themselves in social life, until they somehow
broke loose at the time of the Reformation and began for the first
time to operate on a great scale and with tremendous force. The
view might have some plausibility coming from the mouth of a
disciple of Lamarck, but it cannot be reconciled with Kidd&#8217;s strictly
Neo-Darwinian principles. There is, then, nothing in Kidd&#8217;s grandiloquent
and loosely reasoned, but always interesting pages, to justify
any belief in the improvement of the innate moral disposition during
the historic period<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving this difficult question of the extent and nature
of changes in the innate qualities of peoples during the historic
period, I would define in the following way the position that seems
to me to be well founded. There have been no considerable changes
of innate qualities; and what changes have occurred have probably
been of the nature of retrogression, rather than of advance or improvement;
and this is true of both intellectual and moral qualities.
The improvements of civilised peoples are wholly improvements of
the intellectual and moral traditions. All the great and obvious
changes of social life are in the main changes of these traditions.
Nevertheless, such differences of innate qualities as exist between the
different peoples are very important, because of their cumulative influence
upon their traditions. And, especially, the innate superiorities
of the leading peoples, though relatively small, are of essential significance;
and it is of the first importance for the future prosperity of
the great nations of the present time that they should not suffer
any deterioration of their innate qualities; for they alone have
attained just such a level of innate excellence as renders possible the
existence of civilisation and the growth and continued progress of
great nations. Especially is it essential that they should continue
to produce in large numbers those persons of exceptional moral and
intellectual endowments, whose influence alone can maintain the
vitality of the national traditions and who alone can add anything
of value to them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<h4>THE PROGRESS OF NATIONS IN THEIR YOUTH</h4>

<p>We have found reason to believe that during the historic period the
peoples of Europe have made no progress in innate qualities, moral
or intellectual; yet that period has been characterised by immense
mental development, a development essentially of the collective
mind. The most striking result of the formation of nations and
the development of civilisation has been this replacement of the
progress of the individual mind by the progress of the collective
national mind. And the most interesting and important problem of
group psychology is&mdash;What are the conditions of the progressive
development of the collective mind?</p>

<p>I insist that this is distinctly and primarily a psychological
problem. The conclusion we have just reached, to the effect that it
is not produced by and does not imply a racial evolution, shows that
it is not to be regarded as a biological problem. It cannot be treated
as a problem of economics or of politics; these sciences only touch
its fringe at special points.</p>

<p>We have before us the significant fact that in some cases the collective
mind of a nation has remained stationary at a rudimentary
stage of development for long ages; while in other nations the
collective mind has developed at a constantly accelerating rate,
becoming more highly differentiated and specialised and at the
same time more highly integrated, has in fact developed in a way
closely analogous to the evolution of the individual mind. The
collective mind, in thus developing, reacts upon the development of
individual minds, raising all far above the level they could independently
attain and some in each generation to a very high level
both intellectually and morally.</p>

<p>The merest outline of a discussion of this great problem is alone
possible. I can do no more than offer some suggestions toward the full
solution of it. Let us note, first, that continued progress, far from
being the rule, as is commonly assumed by popular writers, has been a
rare exception, as Sir H. Maine pointed out in <i>Ancient Law</i>. He wrote&mdash;&#8220;In
spite of overwhelming evidence, it is most difficult for a citizen
of Western Europe to bring thoroughly home to himself the truth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
that the civilisation which surrounds him is a rare exception in the
history of the world.&#8221; &#8220;It is indisputable that much the greatest
part of mankind has never shown a particle of desire that its civil
institutions should be improved, since the moment when external
completeness was first given to their embodiment in some permanent
record. Except in a small section of the world, there has
been nothing like the gradual amelioration of a legal system.&#8221; And
what is true of systems of law is true of all the other elements of
the intellectual and moral tradition which constitute a civilisation
or national culture.</p>

<p>Sir H. Maine added&mdash;&#8220;The difference between the stationary
and progressive societies is, however, one of the great secrets
which inquiry has yet to penetrate.&#8221; His own contribution, which
he regarded as a partial solution only, was that the difference
depends in part upon the period at which the customs of a
people become codified in written law. If, as the tribes of a
people become settled and enter upon a national existence, there
is no written code of law and custom, customs, he urged, which
at their origin were socially advantageous tend to become extended
by analogy to other fields of practice and to assume
an excessive and senseless rigour; for example, the custom of
cleanliness becomes the exceedingly elaborate ritual of purification,
which among the Hindus limits and restrains social life at every
point. Or a useful distinction of classes becomes a rigid caste
system, than which nothing is more prejudicial to progress, intellectual
or moral. The continuation of the process of extension
by analogy through long ages has resulted in nearly all the uncivilised
and less civilised peoples of the modern world being bound
down on every hand by a system of rigid and worse than useless
customs, which, restricting both thought and action, render progress
impossible. On the other hand, early codification of custom
in a system of written laws secures that thereafter custom shall
not develop in this blind unintelligent and socially prejudicial
manner, but shall be developed only by deliberate intention and
the reasoned fore-thought of the ruling powers of society; it
will then develop in the main, in spite of many mistakes, in a
way which promotes the efficiency of social life and the welfare
of society.</p>

<p>Maine&#8217;s suggestion is in harmony with the fact that the
progressive peoples have not been those who invented or learnt
the art of writing at an early period. Writing and the written
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
codification of customary law could not be invented by any people
until they had attained to a settled life and a considerable degree
of social organisation; and then, when the invention was worked
out sufficiently, the damage had been done, socially advantageous
customs had already degenerated into useless rites and ceremonial
observances; and writing served only to establish these more firmly,
to fix their yoke upon the necks of the people, as in the case of the
Hindus.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the progressive peoples have been those who
remained in a savage or barbarous condition until a relatively late
period, and who then acquired by imitation the arts of writing and of
reducing custom to written law, acquired them in a fully developed
condition from the peoples who had invented and developed these
arts. They have, therefore, enjoyed the advantages of written laws
from the beginning of their civilisation.</p>

<p>But, as Maine recognised, the acquisition of writing at the
outset of national life is by no means sufficient to account for
the progressiveness of the nations of South and Western Europe;
we must seek other causes and conditions of their mental
progress.</p>

<p>We have already noted certain features of the racial constitution
which were probably essential to the continued progress of the
European peoples&mdash;namely, the high degree of evolution of the social
disposition through group selection in the long prehistoric or race-making
period; a group selection which probably was far more
severe and prolonged than the peoples of any other part of the world
were subjected to; and which in turn was due probably, as we have
seen, to the great diversity of physical surroundings and to the
comparative severity of the climate of Europe, especially of the
northerly parts in which the most progressive European race was
formed; for these physical conditions generated in the race an innate
energy, a capacity for sustained effort.</p>

<p>Without the highly developed social disposition in the mass of
their members, primitive societies could not have survived those
changes of custom and institution which were essential features of
their progress. Without their innate energy, active rivalry and
competition, which have been chief factors in social progress, would
not have been constant features of the relations of these societies.
Still the possession of a highly evolved social disposition by the
European peoples does not in itself suffice to account for the continued
mental evolution of the leading nations. For not all the European
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
peoples have progressed; and, of those that have progressed, some
have done so much more effectively than others.</p>

<p>Let us first examine the question&mdash;In what has progress primarily
consisted? Has it been primarily a progress of the moral or of the
intellectual traditions? As I mentioned in an earlier chapter, we
have here one of the main points of dispute.</p>

<p>Buckle was the great advocate of the primacy of intellectual
development in the sense of increase of natural knowledge. The
argument by which he sought to establish the position runs as follows:
Progress must have been due to improvement either of moral or of
intellectual principles. But moral principles have been almost the
same in all ages. &#8220;To do good to others; to love your neighbour as
yourself; to honour your parents&mdash;these and a few others, are the
sole essentials of morals; but they have been known for thousands
of years, and not one jot or tittle has been added to them by all
the sermons, homilies and text-books which moralists and theologians
have been able to produce.&#8221; On the other hand, knowledge
and intellectual principles have made immense strides; hence all
progress must have been primarily intellectual rather than moral.
Buckle did not deny that there has been some moral progress;
rather he insisted upon it as an essential feature of the progress of
civilisation; but it has, according to him, consisted only in the more
effective operation of unchanging principles, and this more effective
operation is secondary to, and due to, intellectual progress.</p>

<p>I think we must agree with Buckle that the increasing store of
knowledge and the increased command over nature that comes with
it has been the primary condition of the progress of nations. For,
since the early middle ages, the moral natures of men and the
teaching of Christianity have been the same in all essentials; yet
for many centuries there was practically no progress. Kidd himself
admitted that progress only set in rapidly about the time of
the Reformation. And it is notorious that this progress, including
the Reformation itself, was due to the stimulation of the intellect
by a number of influences&mdash;by the renewed study of classical art
and literature, by the discovery of the New World, by the increased
intercourse of nations resulting from the improvement of the art of
navigation, by the accumulation of wealth and the formation of a
powerful middle class. It is clear also that religion, far from having
been the sufficient cause or instrument of progress, was largely
responsible for the stagnation of the middle ages, through sternly
repressing the sceptical spirit and leading off men&#8217;s minds from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
inquiry into natural laws, to the discussion of many topics on which
it was impossible to achieve knowledge and which were necessarily
barren of results making for human progress. Nevertheless the
Christian religion has in the long run co-operated in forwarding the
mental evolution of the European peoples in an important manner
which we must briefly consider later&mdash;namely, through its effects
upon social organisation.</p>

<p>Without raising the question of the natural or supernatural
origin of religion or of any particular religion, we may say that
from the point of view of national life, a religion is essentially a
system of supernatural sanctions for social conduct, for conduct
conforming to the moral code of the society, and especially for customs
regulating the family and the relations of the sexes, on which,
more than on anything else, social stability depends. It is, thus, the
great conservative agency; for it enforces the observance of custom
by a system of rewards and punishments; in the earlier stages of
society, especially by punishments. It is essentially intolerant of
change of custom or belief; and even the Christian religion has
exemplified this principle in the terrible persecutions and innumerable
wars for which it has been responsible.</p>

<p>The great function and tendency of any religion, once established
among a people, is to preserve intact the current moral code and
to secure conformity to it. Nevertheless, some religions are less
prohibitive of progress than others; and, when such a religion replaces
a more restrictive one, an important condition of progress is realised.
But, in so far as progress is then favoured, this is not due to the
changed operations of the religious emotions and sentiments; it is
due to the great religious teachers who have succeeded in breaking
down the bonds imposed by the more primitive religion, and so have
given freer play to the intellectual faculties; the improvements of
religious systems have been negative or permissive conditions of
progress, rather than its effective cause.</p>

<p>Progress has, then, always resulted primarily from the gains made
by the intellect and added to the intellectual tradition, that is to
say, from the progress of knowledge. Nevertheless, the free play of
the intellect is always a danger to society, for the reason that the
customs and moral code of a society, however imperfect and sanctioned
by a religion however narrow, are yet the bonds by which
alone it can be held together; to their influence has been largely
due in every age the subordination by the members of a society of
their individual egoistic ends to the welfare of the society as a whole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>The spirit of inquiry, which always leads men to question the
authority of these customs and moral codes and of their religious
sanctions and thus tends to weaken them, is, then, a socially disruptive
force, at the same time that it is the source of all progress.
Hence, though the free play of the intellect and of the spirit of inquiry
may secure for a time the rapid progress of civilisation, it cannot
alone secure continued progress. Continued progress has only
resulted where there has been maintained a happy balance
between the conservative and the progressive forces, between the
authority of custom and the moral code on the one hand and the
free activity of the intellect on the other. Wherever the progressive
force has outrun the conservative, progress has been
first rapid and then has come abruptly to an end. Greece exemplified
this process in the clearest manner. It was the excessive
seeking of individuals for their own power and glory, unrestrained
by the customs and religious systems which their intellect had
outgrown, that ruptured the bonds of society, plunged the State
into war and civil strife, and eventually destroyed it by the extermination
of the Greek aristocracy. The same is true of the
brilliant but brief periods of rapid progress exhibited by the
medieval Italian States. Intellect outran and undermined morals,
and progress was brought to an end.</p>

<p>Some observers have maintained that history will pass the same
verdict upon modern France, and that most of our leading nations
of the present day are seriously threatened by the same danger.</p>

<p>Any long continued progressive evolution of the mind of a
people has been, then, a rare exception in the history of the world;
partly because the free play of the spirit of inquiry and of the
intellectual faculties, which is the source of all progress, exerts a
socially disruptive tendency, so that progress is by its very nature
dangerous to the stability of any nation; but partly also because
the free play of the spirit of inquiry has been so rarely achieved
or permitted, so that even such progress as has led on to social
disruption has been exceptional.</p>

<p>A long period of intellectual and moral stagnation in the rigid
bonds of custom and religion has been the rule for nearly all the
peoples of the earth, so soon as they had attained to a settled mode
of existence. The primary question, then, to be answered in seeking
to account for the progress of nations, is&mdash;What conditions enabled
the spirit of inquiry to break the bonds of custom and religion and to
extend man&#8217;s knowledge of man and of the world in which he lives?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Bagehot, in considering more particularly the progress of political
institutions, put the problem in much the same way. He pointed
out that the first age of the life of nations is always an age dominated
by custom resting on unquestioned religious sanctions; an age in
which there is often a vast amount of discussion of detail, as, for
example, discussion of the details of military expeditions, but never
discussion of principles; and he maintained that an age marked by
the discussion of principles, involving the questioning of traditions,
moral and intellectual, initiates and characterises every period of
progress.</p>

<p>There is much to be said for the view that the most important
condition of progress in its earlier stages was in most cases, perhaps
in all, the conquest of a more primitive people by one more advanced
in culture or of superior racial type, who remained to settle in the
conquered territory, and, not driving out or exterminating the
conquered inhabitants, established themselves as a governing class.
History and archaeology show that this occurred at least once in
most of the areas where nations have developed spontaneously to
any considerable degree; the earliest known instances being those
of Egypt and Chaldea as long as ten thousand years ago. The same
thing occurred again in India, and later still in Greece; and throughout
early European history the process was frequently repeated in
various areas. Every one of the modern peoples of Europe has been
formed through such fusion by conquest of two peoples, in some
instances several times repeated; and, though none of these modern
European peoples originated their own civilisations, but largely took
over by imitation the civilisation ready made for them by the more
precocious peoples of Asia and by Greece and Rome, these fusions and
the resultant composite character of the European peoples no doubt
have tended greatly to promote progress. And it is easy to see how
in several ways such a fusion by conquest of two peoples must have
tended to set free the spirit of inquiry, that prime condition of
progress. Three of these seem to have been of chief importance.</p>

<p>The most obvious way in which progress has been promoted was
that the conquering invaders became a leisured aristocracy, having
their material needs supplied by the labour of the indigenous population,
which became a more or less servile class. All the ancient
civilisations were thus founded upon servile labour. We may be sure
that, until such a social system resulted from conquest, no people
made much progress; because all individuals were fully occupied in
securing their means of subsistence, either by warfare, by the tending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
of herds, or by agriculture. Each people was self-supporting, and
knew no or few needs beyond those which their own labour was able
to supply; and labour was individual, or was co-operative only
among small groups, such as the communal family groups. It
could, therefore, undertake no great works, whether of building or
engineering, such as large public buildings, irrigation, or road
making. Each family consumed what it produced, and consequently
there was no large accumulation of capital; for there
were no motives for storing up their primitive wealth, and generally
no wealth of durable and storable form.</p>

<p>But, as soon as a ruling class could dispose of the labour of a
large part of the population, making them work for a mere subsistence
wage, there was initiated that r&eacute;gime of capital and labour
on which, up to the present time, all civilisation has been founded.
Wealth was accumulated; great works, such as the pyramids, demanding
enormous expenditure of human life and work, could be
undertaken; and a leisured class was created, which, being freed
from the necessity of bodily toil, was able to turn its energy to
speculative inquiry, to the enjoyment of art and luxury, to directing
and organising the labour of the multitude, to inventing the tools
that render labour more effective, to studying natural phenomena
such as the cycle of the seasons, a more accurate knowledge of which
added to the productivity of labour; for it was in the service of
wealth production, that in the main science arose, especially mathematics
and mechanical and astronomical science, arithmetic and
geometry through the need of a practical art of measurement,
astronomical science through the need of foreseeing the seasons.</p>

<p>The desire to enjoy art and luxury is one which feeds itself and
grows, when once aroused; and it was these growing desires of the
leisured and wealthy classes which created trade, or at any rate
first developed it beyond the merest rudiments; and in doing so led
to regular and friendly intercourse between nations.</p>

<p>A second very important result of such fusion by conquest must
have been the breaking up to some extent of custom and the
weakening of the religious sanctions. Under the new r&eacute;gime, both
the conquering and the conquered peoples would find their old
customs unsuited to their novel social relations, and inadequate to
regulate their changed occupations. The old customs of both would
inevitably be thrown into the melting pot; at the same time the
religious sanctions of both would be weakened by the intimate
contact of two systems, neither of which, in the presence of a rival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
system, would henceforth be able to claim unquestioned authority,
until one had suppressed the other or a stable synthesis of the two had
been effected. So long as each individual never had intercourse with
any but those who accepted the national or tribal religion, it was well-nigh
impossible for anyone to question its authority; but as soon as
the devotees of two religions lived intermixed, the question&mdash;Which
religion was true? must inevitably have arisen in some minds. The
weight of custom and of religious sanctions, which lies so heavily on
a primitive society, restricting all enterprise, forbidding inquiry and
repressing the use of the intellectual powers, would thus be lightened
and scope be given for experiment in thought and action. And
either people, coming into more or less intimate contact for the first
time with a system of beliefs and customs and institutions other
than their own, must have been led to compare, discuss, and reflect
upon these things; the sceptical spirit and the intellect must have
been greatly stimulated. There must have been a conflict of
ideas and the initiation of an age of discussion. In short such a
fusion by conquest must have broken up what Bagehot calls the
&#8216;cake of custom&#8217; as nothing else could, and so have rendered the intellectual
and moral traditions once more plastic and capable of progress.</p>

<p>No doubt in many cases such disintegration of the old systems
went too far, and the society, before it could evolve anew a sufficiently
strong and adequate system of customs and sanctions, went to pieces.
In modern times many primitive societies have been broken up and
destroyed in just this way&mdash;namely, their customs and the religious
sanctions of their morality have been undermined and weakened
by the contact of the more complex systems of civilised men, and
they have not been able to assimilate the new system rapidly enough
to enable it effectively to replace their own shaken and decaying code.</p>

<p>A third way in which the fusion by conquest of two peoples must
have made for progress was by biological blending, the crossing by
intermarriage of the two stocks. We have seen that there is a
considerable amount of evidence to show that, when two stocks are
very widely different in mental and physical characters, the result
of crossing is likely to be bad, the crossed race is likely to be inferior
to, and less fit for the battle of life than, both parental stocks; the
characters of individuals will be apt to be made up of a number of
elements more or less inconsistent with one another; such a composite
character made up of inharmonious elements will be apt to
be unstable and constantly at war with itself. Character of this kind
and the tragic struggles to which it is liable to find itself committed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
has been well described in fiction by a number of authors, especially
in stories of the Mulattoes of America. On the physical side it has
been shown that such cross-bred races tend to die out owing to
lack of balance of the physical constitution.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we saw that the crossing of two closely allied
racial stocks seems to have a tendency to produce a cross-bred race
superior to both parent stocks, and especially to produce a variable
stock. It is, I think, probable that the frequently repeated blending
of allied stocks in Europe has been the fundamental biological
condition of the capacity of the European peoples for progressive
national life.</p>

<p>In the case of the conquest of one people by another differing
very markedly in racial qualities, there seem to be two alternatives
equally prejudicial to the continued progress of the nation so formed.
On the one hand, free intermarriage may take place, resulting in
an inferior cross-bred race incapable of high civilisation, as seems
to have occurred in most of the countries of South America,
where it is with the greatest difficulty that the outward forms
of the high civilisation which they have imitated from Europe are
maintained. On the other hand, where especially the outward
physical characters are very different, the conquering people may
hold itself apart from the conquered, and maintain itself as a
ruling class, which prides itself on the purity of its blood and
which tends to harden into a caste. Such conquest without subsequent
blending gives rise to a civilisation which, being founded
upon a rigid caste system, is incapable of continued progress. This
is what has happened in India. The fair-skinned Aryan invaders
despised the dark-skinned indigenous peoples, whom they spoke of
as being scarcely human, and, in spite of a good deal of crossing,
they have in theory and in the case of the Brahmans at least to a
considerable extent in practice, maintained the purity of their
blood, by means of the development of the caste system.</p>

<p>Europe on the other hand was fortunate in that all the different
peoples, or most of the peoples, from which its nations have been
formed were of allied race; they were all, with few exceptions, of the
white race, sufficiently nearly allied not to produce inferior cross-races
but rather to produce some superior subraces. The conquered
peoples have been so similar to their conquerors in physical
type that crossing could take place without the cross-bred offspring
bearing the indelible marks of inferior or mixed parentage, such
as a dark skin or a woolly head. Hence, although caste systems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
were formed, they did not prove rigid; free intermarriage took
place, and it was not impossible for individuals of the conquered
race or of the mixed stock to rise into the superior ruling class.
The importance of this may be seen, on reflecting how the merest
trace of negro-blood in individuals of mixed origin in North America
is apt to show itself in the physical features and how, even in that
enlightened and Christian country, a trace so revealed suffices to
condemn a man, no matter how great his powers or refined his
character, to remain a member of the inferior caste.</p>

<p>But, apart from the possible improvement of the racial qualities
of the whole people, or of the average individuals in general, which
may well have occurred in Europe, the biological blending of allied
races may give important advantages to the resulting people in
another way&mdash;namely, by increasing its variability, the variability
of its mental qualities. If a people is extremely homogeneous in
the racial sense, it may be expected to display little variability, its
members will be of essentially similar mental qualities and of a
uniform level of mental capacity; and this will tend to make them
a very stable, but a very conservative unprogressive, nation. This
seems to be true of China, and to be in large part the source of its
extreme stability and extreme conservatism.</p>

<p>Where, on the other hand, a people is formed by the intimate
blending by intermarriage of two or more racial stocks, it is likely
to be a variable one; there will be large departures in many directions
from the average type of mental ability, and there will be individuals
varying by excess of development of various capacities as well as
others varying by defect of development.</p>

<p>And a people of variable and therefore widely diversified mental
capacities will, even though its average capacity is no greater than
that of a more homogeneous people, be more likely to make progress
in civilisation, and this for three reasons.</p>

<p>First, variability is the essential condition of all race progress
by biological adaptation; for it is by the selection of variations,
the survival and multiplication of types varying in certain directions
in larger proportions than the average type, that all race progress
and adaptation seems to have been achieved. Hence, increased
variability, resulting from the blending of races, will render a people
so formed capable of race progress and of more rapid adaptation;
for example, in the peoples of Northern Europe it would have
favoured the adaptation of the constitutions of the people to the
severity of the climate and to those peculiar social conditions which,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
as we have seen reason to believe, have been the source of their
unique combination of qualities.</p>

<p>Secondly, variability of mental qualities would be favourable to
the coming of the age of discussion; for in such a people custom would
rule with less force, its sway would be more apt to be questioned and
disputed, than among a highly homogeneous people.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and this is probably the most important manner in
which race blending has favoured the progress of nations, among
the variations from the average type produced by race crossing
would be men of exceptional capacities in various directions.</p>

<p>We have already noted that all progress of the intellectual and
moral traditions eventually depends upon the activities of men of
exceptional powers of various kinds, upon the great religious or
ethical teacher, the inventor, the artist, the discoverer. A people
may, like the Chinese, have a high average capacity of intellectual
ability; but, if it cannot from time to time produce men of far more
than average capacity along various lines, it will not progress very
far spontaneously. Exceptional intellectual capacity is, however, a
variation from the type, as the biologists say, just such as may be
expected to result from race blending; there will be, among the
variations in all directions, variations in the direction of exceptional
capacity of various kinds. Hence a nation of blended variable
stocks will, other things being the same, be far more likely to be
capable of continued evolution than a homogeneous people of equal
average mental capacity, among whom few men are capable of rising
to any distinguished height.</p>

<p>This view of the effects of race blending is borne out empirically by
the comparison of the peoples of the world. The European peoples
have been the most progressive, and they, more than all others, have
been formed by repeated blendings of allied stocks. Within Europe
it is the peoples among whom this blending has been carried furthest
who have proved most progressive&mdash;the French, the English, and the
Italian; and, conversely, the least blended peoples have been the
most backward, and have contributed least to the general progress
of civilisation in Europe; for example the large, almost purely Slav,
population which forms the bulk of the Russian nation.</p>

<p>We pass on to consider other conditions which have contributed
to setting free and stimulating the spirit of inquiry. We have seen
that physical environment played a predominant part in moulding
the mental qualities of races in the prehistoric period. And we must
recognise that, although with the beginning of settled national life
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
it probably ceased to modify race-qualities to any considerable
extent, it has yet been important in favouring the rapid evolution
of the intellectual tradition of some peoples, and this in several ways.
First, by its direct influence upon the minds of individuals. Buckle
and others have pointed out that, while, in India and throughout a
great part of Asia, the physical environment was unfavourable to
intellectual progress, while its vast and terrible aspects fertilised
the superstition of the people, and repressed the spirit of inquiry
by rendering hopeless any attempt to cope with its terrific displays
of force, in Europe and especially in South and Western Europe,
the comparatively small scale on which the physical features are
planned and the relative feebleness of the forces of nature encouraged
men to adopt a bolder attitude towards them.</p>

<p>Buckle, contrasting Greece with India in this respect, showed
how the physical features of both countries were reflected in their
national cultures; how, while the Hindus cringed in fear before
monstrous and cruel gods, the Greeks fashioned their gods in their
own image, simply personifying each leading human attribute, and
made of them a genial family of beings, differing from men and women
in little but their immortality and their superior facilities for the
enjoyment of life. In general the buoyancy and serenity of the
Greek attitude towards life and nature reflected the beautiful, secure
and diversified aspects of their physical environment. In such an
atmosphere the spirit of inquiry would naturally flourish more freely
than where man&#8217;s spirit was oppressed by the fear of terrible and
uncontrollable forces and where he was made to feel too keenly
the limitations of his mental and physical powers. Buckle summed
up his review of these effects as follows:&mdash;&#8220;In the civilisations
exterior to Europe, all nature conspired to increase the authority
of the imaginative faculties and to weaken the authority of the
reasoning ones. In Europe has operated a law the reverse of
this, by virtue of which the tendency of natural phenomena is,
on the whole, to limit the imagination, and embolden the understanding;
thus inspiring man with confidence in his own resources,
and facilitating the increase of his knowledge, by encouraging that
bold, inquisitive and scientific spirit, which is constantly advancing
and on which all future progress must depend.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think we must accept this view of the importance of the direct
action of physical environment on the minds of individuals. To
deny, as Hegel did, the important influence of physical environment
upon the development of Greek culture, because the Turks have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
enjoyed a similar climate without producing a similar culture, is
unreasonable. The progress of civilisation has always been the
result of a multiplicity of causes and conditions; and we cannot
deny all importance to any one, whether race or climate or social
organisation or religion or any other, because in some particular
instance it has failed to produce the progress of which in other
instances it has been one of a number of co-operating causes.</p>

<p>The diversity and small scale of the physical features of South
and Western Europe has favoured the progress of the intellectual
tradition in another important way. The land is divided by natural
barriers into a number of natural territories, the population of
each of which has naturally tended to become one nation and to
develop a national culture. In this way there arose a number of
nations and States in close proximity with one another, yet each
developing along its own lines. When the development of wealth
and commerce brought these diversified cultures into friendly intercourse
with one another, the exchange of ideas and the general
imitation of the useful arts of one people by its neighbours must
have made very strongly for progress; the culture of each of a group
of neighbouring peoples no longer progressed only by the addition
of the ideas and inventions of its own exceptional intellects, but
each group had the opportunity of selecting and imitatively adopting
whatever seemed to them best among the ideas, the arts and inventions
of the neighbouring peoples.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that this was one of the main conditions
of the rapid development of the culture of the ancient Greeks,
situated as they were within easy reach of several of the oldest
civilisations, those of Egypt and of South-Eastern Asia; they were
also within reach of a number of less civilised peoples, and therefore
enjoyed opportunities for trade of a kind which, being peculiarly
lucrative, has in all ages hastened the acquisition of wealth and
capital and stimulated the development of commerce. All the
most progressive European peoples have enjoyed similar advantages;
and it has been maintained with some plausibility that the principal
cause of the shifting of the centre of progressive civilisation from the
Eastern Mediterranean to the west of Europe has been the improvement
of the art of navigation and the discovery of the New World
and of the sea route to Asia and the East Indies; for these gave the
western countries the most advantageous positions for the conduct
of a world wide commerce. No doubt the factor mentioned has
been important in producing this change.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>But, when we consider the ancient European civilisations and
compare them with our own, we realize that, in spite of all the circumstances
which we have enumerated and briefly considered as
factors stimulating the spirit of inquiry and making for progress of
their intellectual tradition, and in spite of their brilliant and in
some respects unapproachable achievements, they were nevertheless
radically incapable of continued progress. Greek civilisation certainly
progressed at a marvellous rate for some centuries; yet there is
every reason to believe that it bore within itself the inevitable
causes of its ultimate decay or stagnation. And, when we consider
Roman civilisation, we see that, through all the long centuries of
the greatness of Rome, it was essentially unprogressive. There
was no continued evolution of the national mind and character.
Save in respect to the single province of law, Roman civilisation,
when it entered upon the period of its decay, had not appreciably
progressed in any essential respects beyond the stage reached more
than a thousand years earlier. Rome was in fact less truly a nation
in its later than in its earlier age. It had superficially imitated
rather more of Greek culture and it had incorporated a number of
bizarre elements from the many peoples which had been brought
under the sway of the Roman sceptre; but neither in religion, nor
in philosophy, nor art, nor science, nor in any of the practical modes
of controlling the forces of nature, had it made any substantial gains;
and its social organisation tended more and more to the type of a
centralised irresponsible bureaucracy<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, it cannot be denied that in the last thousand
years the nations of Western Europe have made immense progress;
nor that this progress has been accelerating from century to century
in a way which seemed to reach a climax in the wonderful century
just closed; though there appears good prospect of continued progress
and perhaps of continued acceleration throughout the century to
come and perhaps for many more.</p>

<p>What then is the cause of this great difference between the
civilisation of Western Europe and all preceding civilisations?
The difference is, I think, essentially due to difference of social
organisation. As argued in a previous chapter, social organisation
was of less influence in the earlier ages, but has assumed a
constantly increasing importance throughout the evolution of civilisation;
and it is now predominant over all other conditions.
We must, then, first define this difference of social organisation;
secondly, we must show how it makes for progress; and thirdly,
conjecture how the social organisation of Western Europe, so favourable
to the continued development of nations, has been brought
about.</p>

<p>The great difference which divides the social organisation of
the modern progressive peoples from that of all the ancient European
civilisations is that, under it, the individual enjoys greater liberty
and more securely founded rights as against the community, and
as against all other individuals. This change is summed up in
Sir H. Maine&#8217;s dictum that &#8220;the movement of progressive societies
has hitherto been a movement from status to contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the ancient civilised societies, Greece and Rome no less than
all the others, rested upon the fundamental assumption of the
absolute supremacy of the State, the assumption that the individual
existed only for the State and that the welfare of the State was the
supreme end to which all individual rights and liberties must be
subordinated absolutely, was the end to the securing of which all
custom, and all law, all social and family relations and institutions
and religion itself were but the means. And the State was a politico-religious
organisation, membership of which implied the blood-relationship
of its citizens and a common participation in the
state-religion; while the State gods were conceived as being themselves
ancestors, or in some other way kinsmen, of the citizens<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.
This bond of blood or kinship between the members of the State
and its gods went back to the earliest times. It is the rule of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
almost all savage peoples; and the religious rites of many include
some rite symbolising or renewing this blood bond, such as smearing
the blood of the kinsmen on the altars of the gods, or drinking the
blood of some animal which is held to be the symbolic representative
of the god. And the supreme end of the State itself was the
increase of its own power and stability, through the exercise of
military power and through military conquest.</p>

<p>All human beings outside the State, outside this moral-politico-religious-bond,
were regarded as <i>prima facie</i> enemies of the State,
without rights of any sort, without even the slightest claim to
humane treatment. Hence, in war the slaughter of the conquered
was the rule; and the practice of making slaves of prisoners of war
and of conquered peoples only arose through its profitableness, and
was regarded as a great concession to the victims, whose natural
fate was sudden death. Under this system, which inevitably became
to some extent a caste system, with a caste of freemen or citizens
ruling over slaves, each individual was born to a certain status as
a member of a particular family. His position and duties and rights
in the family were rigidly prescribed by custom, and the law took
account only of the relations of the family to the State.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h4>THE PROGRESS OF NATIONS IN THEIR MATURITY</h4>

<p>In the foregoing chapter we have noted the great fact that the
leading modern nations of Western Europe have shown a much
greater capacity for progress than all the earlier civilised peoples,
not excepting those of ancient Greece and Rome. I urged that this
difference between the ancient and the modern European civilisations
seemed to be chiefly due to a difference of social organisation.
I pointed out how the older nations were essentially caste nations,
resting on a basis of slavery, and how all individual rights were
entirely subordinated to the welfare of the State, a politico-religious
organisation held together by the bond of kinship; how,
within that organisation, the rights of each person were strictly
defined throughout his life by the status to which he was born;
and how all persons outside this organisation were regarded as
natural enemies, towards whom no obligations of any kind were
felt. We have now to notice that the form of social organisation
towards which all the leading modern nations have been tending,
and which some of them have now pretty well achieved, is one in
which the last vestiges of the caste system and the rigid bonds of
customary status are rapidly being abolished. In this new organisation
social classes persist, but they are no longer castes; all members
of the nation are regarded as being by nature free and equal; a
career is open to every talent, and any man may rise to any position
by the exertion of his abilities. His position is one of extreme liberty
as compared with that of any member of the ancient nations. He
has definite rights as against the State. The State claims only a
minimum of rights over him, the right to prevent him interfering
with the rights of his fellow-citizens, the right to make him pay for
his share of the privileges conveyed by its activities. And these
rights it claims in virtue of contract between each citizen and all
the rest. For each citizen is free to throw off his allegiance to the
State and to leave it at will, and his continuance as a citizen of
the State implies his acceptance of the contract.</p>

<p>Even in religion, personal liberty has at last been achieved;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
religion is no longer a State-religion, the gods are no longer the
national gods, and each man may accept any religion or none. This
is the most striking instance of the immense distance, as regards the
liberty of the individual, that divides the modern from the ancient
nations. For with the latter, the function of religion was to preserve
the security of the State; and to question it in any way was to
threaten the State, a principle fully acted upon by Athens in the
time of her highest enlightenment and glory.</p>

<p>The change is very striking also as regards the attitude of the
citizens of one State towards those of any other and towards even
the members of savage and barbarous communities. We no longer
regard ourselves as devoid of all obligation towards such persons.
Rather we tend to treat them as having equal rights with ourselves,
the few specifically national rights excepted, and as having equal
claims with our fellow citizens upon our considerate feeling and
conduct towards them.</p>

<p>The relations of individuals are, then, tending to be regulated, on
the one hand, by contractual justice; on the other hand, by the moral
obligation felt by each individual, an obligation not enforced by any
exercise of the power of the State, but supported only by public
opinion. The end we set before ourselves is no longer the welfare
of the State, to be attained at any cost to individual liberty; it is
rather an ideal of justice for every person, to which the welfare of
the State must be, if necessary, subordinated. In short, instead of
maintaining universal intolerance, we have made great strides
towards universal tolerance.</p>

<p>All this represents a profound change of social organisation, a
great advance in social evolution. That it is intimately bound up
with the progressiveness of a people is shown by the fact that the
degree to which the change has proceeded among the various nations
runs parallel with their progress in all the essentials of civilisation.
The change seems, indeed, to be one of the principal conditions of
the progress of the nations of Western Europe and, we may add,
of the American nation, by which it has been carried further than
by any other. How, then, does it make for progress? We may
answer this question by considering how the social system which
has given place to this new kind of social organisation&mdash;namely, the
caste system&mdash;renders progress difficult or impossible.</p>

<p>Where the caste system is highly developed and rigidly maintained,
as among the Hindus of India, its conservative unprogressive
tendency is obvious enough. Each man is born a member of some one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
of many castes, and he can never hope to pass from one caste to
another and higher caste. That fact alone removes at once the two
greatest spurs to effort, the two most powerful motives that urge on
the members of our modern societies to the fullest development and
exercise of all their faculties; namely, the desire to rise in the social
scale and to place one&#8217;s children at a more advantageous starting
point in the battle of life, and the fear of falling back in the social
scale, of sinking to a lower level, with the consequent sacrifice of all
the social consideration and other advantages which one&#8217;s position
at any given social level brings with it. Under the Hindu caste
system, the poor Brahmin who has no possessions, perhaps not even
a rag to cover his nakedness, is sure of the social consideration which
his birth gives him, both for himself and his children. He can look
disdainfully upon the rich man and the prince of lower caste; and
public opinion approves and supports him. This perhaps is the
most important way in which the caste system prevents progress.
But there are others almost equally serious.</p>

<p>The occupations open to the members of each caste are rigidly
limited. The members of one caste must be priests only, of another
soldiers only, of another scavengers, of another potters, and so on.
Now, if it were true that, when dexterities or mental powers generally
are specially developed by use, the improvements of faculty resulting
from this long practice and use were transmitted in any degree
from generation to generation, we should expect the caste system
to result, after many generations, in so many distinct breeds of men
of highly specialised and perfected powers of the kinds used in the
pursuit of each of the caste occupations. And this might make for
progress. Each man would be employed in the occupation for which
he was best suited. But, as we have seen, it is probable that use-inheritance
does not occur; and there seems to be no evidence that
differentiation and hereditary specialisation of faculties of this sort
result from the caste system<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. In each caste men continue to be born
of the most diverse powers suited for the most diverse occupations;
and one effect of the caste system is that the best powers of any man
will in the great majority of cases be prevented from finding their
most effective outlet. That involves a great waste of faculty, which
makes strongly for stagnation. We shall realize the importance of
this influence, if we reflect on the great achievements, in the most
diverse fields, of men who under our modern system have risen from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
some humble station and occupation, to which under the caste system
they would have been rigidly confined.</p>

<p>Again, within each caste custom rules the lives of the members
with much greater force than it can exert in a large and complex
society in the absence of the caste system. For each caste has its
own tradition and customary code, which is necessarily narrow
because of the uniformity of the conditions of life of those who
obey it; hence tradition and custom have a narrow and well-defined
field of operation; and the narrower the field of its application, the
more rigidly will custom control action.</p>

<p>The caste system is thus one which permits of great differentiation
and specialisation of pursuits, without any weakening of the conservative
forces of society. It is for that reason presumably that the
social organisation of all early civilisations tended to this form. It
was the most easily attained form which combined diversity with
stability sufficiently to permit of the formation of a large society
or nation; and it was one which made for military efficiency. It
formed, therefore, a natural stage of social evolution.</p>

<p>In so far as the caste system still survives, it owes its survival
to the continuance of the need of the State for military efficiency.
And we see how its maintenance is still only rendered possible by
its alliance with a State religion and its system of religious sanctions.
In Russia, for example, the caste system was thus maintained by
the alliance of the military power with the religious system. While
we see how in modern Germany the attempt to maintain the caste
system and the supremacy of the State over the rights and liberties
of individuals is breaking down, as the religious sanctions are losing
their hold upon the people. Social democracy, secularism, and the
demand for liberty go hand in hand<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that the caste system tends to produce a stable
society and to prevent progress; and that, in proportion as it gives
way to liberty and equality of all men, both legal and customary,
and to the recognition of the rights of individuals as against the
State, progress must be favoured.</p>

<p>In yet another way (perhaps more important than any other)
the abolition of caste may favour development. In an earlier
chapter I pointed out how every step in the development of the
intellectual or the moral tradition of a people is initiated by some
person of exceptional intellectual or moral power. I pointed out
also how the existence of a hierarchy of social classes which are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
not exclusive castes, together with the operation of the social
ladder by means of which individuals and families are enabled
to climb up and down the social scale, tend to the segregation
of ability in the classes of the upper part of the scale. They tend,
in short, to produce classes capable of producing in each generation
a relatively large number of persons of more than average
capacities. Or, in other words, they lead to the concentration and
mutual enrichment of the strains of exceptional capacity; they
concentrate the best capacities of the people in a relatively small
number of individuals of the favoured classes. And abilities so
concentrated and raised in a certain proportion of individuals to a
higher power will be more favourable in every way to the growth
of the national mind than the same sum of abilities more evenly
diffused throughout the population. At present it is impossible to
say how far this segregation of abilities has gone, and what part it
has played in forwarding the mental development of any nation.
But that it has played some part, perhaps a very important one in
some instances, can hardly be doubted<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<p>In Europe the feudal system served to tide over the period of
transition from the ancient social organisation founded on caste and
the supremacy of the politico-religious State to the modern system,
the transition from the system founded on status and regulated by
custom to the system founded upon equality and liberty and regulated
by contract. For the feudal system, although still more or less
a caste system, was nevertheless founded to some extent on contract.
The tenure of land involved a contract to perform services in return;
and such contract was the essence of the feudal system.</p>

<p>But it was not until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
when the feudal system was finally broken up and the Reformation
initiated the age of religious tolerance, that the modern system
substantially replaced the ancient system, and the age of rapid
progress set in.</p>

<p>In proportion as the change was achieved, the powers of all
men were set free in an unfettered competition such as had
never before been possible. Independence of thought and action,
free discussion of all principles, and the recognition of the relativity
of all truths, succeeded to unquestioning subservience to ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
formulas and customs. Each man became comparatively free to
follow his natural bent, to develop his best powers to the utmost,
and to secure by the exercise of those powers the maximum of
social consideration and of well-being, unfettered by arbitrary
restrictions, civil or ecclesiastical. I think we may fairly say that the
modern pragmatic or humanistic movement in philosophy, in the
midst of which we are living, represents the final stage of this emancipation
of man from the bonds which he has created for himself.</p>

<p>We have seen, then, that the modern system of social organisation
does not make for the racial progress of a whole people, but probably,
up to the present time, for race-deterioration; nevertheless, it certainly
makes for progress of the intellectual and moral traditions of
peoples; and we can now see in what way it makes for progress.
The improvement of racial qualities by natural selection of the
innately superior individuals has been brought to an end; the
mortal conflict of societies has also practically been abolished as a
factor of race progress, as also of collective or social progress. These
have been replaced by a new form of struggle for existence and of
selection&mdash;namely, the rivalry and competition of ideas and of the
institutions in which ideas become embodied, and the selection for
survival of those ideas and institutions which are found, under the
tests of practice and experience, most accordant with the truth and,
therefore, best adapted to promote the welfare of societies and of
their members<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

<p>And this process of survival of the fittest and elimination of the
unfit among ideas and institutions takes place not only within
nations, but has also international scope. The members of each nation
no longer, as of old, regard all foreigners as their natural enemies,
no longer despise their institutions and reject their ideas with
scorn. They are ready to learn from others, to let the ideas current
among other peoples enter into competition with native-born ideas;
and so the number and variety of competing elements increases and
the intensity of the competition waxes ever keener. Every idea that
constitutes an important advance in our intellectual outlook or in our
practical command over nature rapidly finds acceptance throughout
the civilised world and displaces some less true idea, some less appropriate
institution, some less effective mode of action.</p>

<p>Two great conditions, making for continued improvement of
the moral and intellectual traditions, characterise, then, Western
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
civilisation. First, within each nation there is going on the process
of emancipation of all human faculties, so that they enter into the
freest possible competition with one another on a footing of equality;
this process, although now far advanced in all the leading nations, is
still being carried further, and the whole trend of modern legislation
is to confirm the change and hasten it to its completion<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. Secondly,
there is a circle of peoples whose ideas are thrown into the arena of
rivalry, to suffer extinction or to gain universal acceptance. This
circle also is constantly widening by the inclusion of peoples hitherto
outside it; and each new admission, as of Japan in recent years, is
a new stimulus to the further evolution of the collective mind of
each nation concerned. Both these conditions depend upon improved
social organisation.</p>

<p>How then has this great change of social organisation been
effected? To put this question is to approach an immense subject,
the history of liberty and toleration. I can only make one or two
brief remarks. It has been suggested by many authors, notably
by Kidd in his volume on <i>Western Civilisation</i>, that we owe this
great change to the Christian religion. It is pointed out that the
Christian religion, unlike most earlier religions, was from the first
not a national or State religion but a universal religion, and that its
adoption has weakened the tyranny of the State by breaking
up its alliance with religion. Further, it is a religion which, by its
doctrine of the immortality of the souls of all men, has tended to
give dignity and value to each individual life, quite independently
of personal status. Again, by its teaching of universal charity, it
has to some extent softened and moralised the relations of men
and of societies. But, that the replacement of a national religion by
a universal religion which teaches the equality of all believers does
not suffice to secure continued collective evolution is shown by the
instances of Bhuddism and Mohammedanism. Both of these are
of this character, yet both have failed to render continuously progressive
the societies that have accepted them.</p>

<p>That the spread of the Christian religion does not in itself suffice
to account for the evolution from the ancient to the modern type
of social organisation is shown also by the fact that it had held undisputed
sway among the peoples of Western Europe for more than
a thousand years before social evolution made any considerable
advance. Throughout that period, religion constantly called in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
civil and military power of the State to enforce the acceptance of its
dogmas. And that its teachings did not suffice to produce religious
or civil tolerance is shown by the fierce and incessant persecutions
of heretics and the many religious wars that fill the history of
medieval Europe.</p>

<p>The religious tolerance and liberty of the modern era are rather
features of a wider phenomenon, the general increase of tolerance
and liberty, and they must be ascribed to the same causes as this
wider fact. They imply a great evolution of the moral tradition,
the most important and striking feature of which is the expansion
of the sphere in which the sympathetic feelings find application.
There is no reason to suppose that the feelings and emotions
underlying the sympathetic and considerate treatment of others have
changed in character in the historic period. For long ages men have
felt such sympathy and given considerate and just treatment to those
who have been nearest to them; at first to the members of their
own immediate family; later to the fellow-members of their own
small society; and then, as societies expanded into complex caste
societies, to the members of their own caste; later, as castes were
broken down, to all their fellow citizens; and still later in some
degree to all men.</p>

<p>It is this progressive extension of the sphere of imaginative
sympathy which, more than anything else, has broken down all the
social barriers that confined the energies of men and has set free
their various faculties in that competition of ever increasing severity
which is the principal cause underlying the modern progress of
peoples. It is this which has destroyed nearly all the old bonds that
fettered and limited men&#8217;s activities in religion, in science, in politics,
in art, in commerce, in manufacture, and has brought men in all
these spheres into that intense, because free and equal, competition,
which produces an ever accelerating progress. It is this which has
produced the almost universal acceptance of the entirely and most
characteristically modern principle of &#8216;one man one vote,&#8217; a principle
so hard to justify on any ground of expediency, from any considerations
of the stability and welfare of the State. It is this also which
has led to so greatly increased intercourse between peoples.</p>

<p>It is sometimes contended that the realisation of the principles
of equality and justice for all men has been secured only by the strife
of the social classes, by the success of the lower classes in forcing
a series of concessions from the ruling classes. This is a very imperfect
and partial view of the process. If the ruling classes had consistently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
sought to maintain their power and exclusive privileges, and to
maintain all the rest of society in a state of servitude or serfdom,
there is little doubt that they could have done so. But their position
has been weakened from within by the extension of their sympathies.
Consider the great series of legislative changes which, during the
nineteenth century, transformed the social organisation of this
country, especially the factory laws, the franchise extension laws,
and the laws for the abolition of slavery. These were for the most
part of the nature of a voluntary abdication of power on the part
of the classes in possession. Consider the topics which chiefly engross
the attention of our legislators and are the centre of political and
social discussion. They are the providing of a better and freer education
for the children of the working classes, who of themselves would
probably never have thought of such a thing; the providing of free
meals for school children; the providing of work and food for the
unemployed; temperance laws, land settlement, and emigration, the
eight-hours day, housing of the working classes, free trade and cheap
food, old age pensions; all measures for raising the standard of life of
the labouring classes and securing them against the tyranny of capital.</p>

<p>In respect of our relations to the lower peoples the same proposition
holds good. It would be easy for the European nations to
exterminate the black people of Africa, and to possess themselves
of all their lands<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. But public opinion will not now allow this; it
insists upon our moral obligation towards such peoples, that we are
bound to try to help them to survive and to raise themselves to our
level of culture.</p>

<p>The extension of the sphere of application of imaginative sympathy
has then been a factor of prime importance in producing the
social evolution which underlies modern progress.</p>

<p>The factors that have brought about this extension have been
many and complex, and it is perhaps a hopeless task to attempt to
enumerate them and to apportion to each its share of influence.
Undoubtedly, it has been produced largely by the influence of a
relatively small number of enlightened leaders of opinion, such men
as Wilberforce, Stuart Mill, Shaftesbury, John Locke, Rousseau, and
Voltaire&mdash;men whose original intellectual powers enabled them to
criticise and reject the settled principles of their time. It was a
work of liberation from custom and traditional prejudice effected
by the spirit of inquiry, which questioned the validity of the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
narrow conceptions of the relations of men and peoples, the old
narrow prejudices of caste and nation, and discovered their fallacies
to the world; discovered, for example, that men of a religious persuasion
slightly different from one&#8217;s own are not necessarily wicked,
nor those of a different nationality necessarily despicable and possessed
of no ideas worthy of admiration and adoption.</p>

<p>But the ground was prepared for the reception of the teachings
of such men by the conflicts of men who desired nothing of tolerance
and equality and liberty. This is best illustrated by the history of
religious toleration. As I said before, religion is essentially conservative
and intolerant of heresies. The first effect on religion
of that revival and liberation of the spirit of inquiry which we call
the Renascence, was to produce not religious toleration, but rather
a bitter conflict of mutually intolerant sects. And religious toleration
was eventually achieved largely by the realisation of the necessity
of compromise among these warring and constantly multiplying
sects; it was found impossible to weed out heresy by persecution.
Yet who can doubt that the Church, if it believed that it saw its
way to secure the universal acceptance of its doctrines by means of
persecution, would long hesitate to return to its ancient practices?
The coming of religious toleration was due to the application of
the spirit of inquiry to religious systems; these inquiries produced
irreconcilable sects, whose strife prepared the way for compromise
and toleration.</p>

<p>The strife of parties and sects was itself part of a still wider
process; and this process must be recognised as the most important
single condition of that widening of the sphere of imaginative
sympathy which has been the root cause of the improvement of
social organisation, of the general increase of liberty, and thus of
the progress of the modern nations. This wider process is the general
increase of human intercourse, both within nations and between
them. Only so long as men know little of one another, can they
continue to regard one another with entire hostility or cold indifference.
The knowledge and understanding brought by personal
intercourse is necessary to sympathy; but as soon as, and in proportion
as, such knowledge is acquired, the innate social tendencies
common to all men are brought into play. As soon as man understands
that his fellow man suffers the same pains and joys as himself,
longs for the same goods, fears the same evils, throbs with the same
emotions and desires, then he shares with him in some degree these
feelings, in virtue of that fundamental law of all social beings, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
law of primitive sympathy; then also pity and sympathetic sorrow
and tender regard are awakened in his breast; then his fellow man is
no longer the object of his cold or hostile glances, as a certain rival
and probable enemy, but is seen to be a fellow toiler and sufferer
whom he is willing to succour, a fellow creature whose joys and
sorrows alike he cannot but share in some degree.</p>

<p>Increasing freedom of intercourse throughout the civilised world,
and beyond its boundaries also, has been the most characteristic
feature of the age of progress, and in it we may recognise the most
fundamental condition of that progress. Science and mechanical
invention have been the means by which this greater freedom of
intercourse has been brought about. First and most important
perhaps was the invention of printing, the consequent spread of the
habit of reading, and the wide diffusion of the written word. Second
only to this was the improvement of the art of navigation, which
brought the remotest peoples of the world within the ken of Europe
and greatly promoted the intercourse of the European peoples, as
well as the circulation of persons and news within each nation; for
the development of commerce over seas implies a corresponding
development of commerce within the national boundaries. Then
came the use of steam in locomotion on sea and land, the press and
the telegraph; and, with the advent of these, intercourse within
and without became really free and abundant; mutual knowledge
and understanding between men and nations grew rapidly, and the
age of progress was assured.</p>

<p>The progressive character of the modern nations has been due,
then, to the actions and reactions between the spirit of inquiry and
the improvement of forms of social organisation; each step in the
one respect has reacted upon the other, stimulating further change
in the same direction. And the medium through which they have
chiefly thus worked upon one another has been the increase of
intercourse between men and nations. The spirit of inquiry has
urged men on to explore their fellow men and to study foreign
nations, and it has provided the means for so doing; the greater
mutual knowledge and sympathy thus brought into being have in
turn brought greater liberty to the spirit of inquiry, freeing it from
the rigid bonds of custom and conservative tradition and enabling
it to render human intercourse yet more free and abundant.</p>

<p>In this way we reconcile and synthesize the rival theories of the
causes of progress, the view that sees in the spirit of inquiry the
sole agent of progress and that which attributes it wholly to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
improvement of morals and of social organisation. The great commandment,
&#8220;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,&#8221; pointed the
way of all progress; but great and beautiful as it was, it could not
immediately avail to break the bonds of the human spirit, the bonds
of ignorance and fear; only gradually through increase of knowledge
could man learn that all men are his neighbours, and that not only
the foreigner just beyond the frontier, but also the naked savage,
chipping his stone axe or weaving his rude basket for the reception
of his neighbour&#8217;s head, is a man of like passions with himself, with
equal claims upon justice and freedom and all that makes the
humanity of man.</p>

<p>It only remains to point out the part in human life of a new
factor of progress which promises to eclipse all others in importance.
The main theme of my earlier work<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> was that only through increase
of knowledge of others is each man&#8217;s knowledge of himself slowly
built up and enriched, until it renders him capable of enlightened self-direction.
So the main theme of this book is the development of the
group mind, the increase of its self-knowledge and of its power of self-direction
through increase of knowledge of other human societies.</p>

<p>The age of progress through which the world has recently passed
was an age of progress due to increase of human intercourse and
consequent increasing understanding by each nation of other nations
and peoples. This better knowledge of other peoples is now reacting
upon the self-knowledge of each nation, rapidly enriching it. Each
of the great nations is beginning to understand itself, and to take
thought for the morrow in the light of this self-knowledge; and this
increase of national self-knowledge, this enrichment of national
self-consciousness, is the great new factor which alone can secure
the further progress of mankind. We saw in an earlier chapter that
a nation is essentially the realization of an idea, the idea of a nation,
that only in so far as the idea of the nation exists and operates in
the minds of the members of the nation, controlling their conduct
and directing it to actions having reference to the nation as a whole,
does a nation come into and continue in existence. The self-consciousness
of nations is therefore not a new factor in their life. But
their self-consciousness is now becoming reflective and immensely
richer in content; so much so that it promises to operate virtually
as a new factor of tremendous efficiency.</p>

<p>We may illustrate the influence of this new factor by reverting
again to the analogy between the mind of the individual and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
mind of the nation which we developed at some length in an earlier
chapter. In the developing individual, as in the evolving animal
series, the development of self-consciousness is the condition of the
development of true volition. Before self-consciousness and a self-regarding
sentiment are developed, conduct is determined by feelings
and impulses or by ideas and the desires they arouse, either some
one desire rising alone to consciousness and issuing at once
in action, or through a conflict of impulses and desires, some one
of which eventually predominates over the others and determines
action; but action issuing from such a conflict of impulses and
desires is not true volition. Action is truly volitional only when the
ideal of the self in relation to the idea of the end to be achieved by
each of the conflicting tendencies determines the issue of the conflict.</p>

<p>In the mental life of nations, all those conflicts of ideas, of
parties, of principles and of systems, in which each strives to predominate
over and displace others, and by natural selection of which
(the death of the many less fit, the survival of the few better or more
fit) the progress of recent centuries has been chiefly due; all these
conflicts have been more or less blind conflicts, in which the idea of
the whole nation, in relation to the end to be achieved by each of
the conflicting tendencies, has generally played but a small part and
a part that often has not made strongly for progress. National
actions were in the main impulsive and instinctive actions, like those
of young children or the higher animals. And for this reason&mdash;that
nations had too little true self-knowledge, and had not developed a
true and rich ideal of national life&mdash;the self-consciousness of nations
was too poor in content to serve as the guide of actions making for
progress.</p>

<p>In the individual man, it is the growing richness and accuracy
of self-knowledge which alone enables him to direct his actions
effectively to secure his own welfare and to improve his character
and powers. Just so in nations the rapid growth of their self-knowledge
and the enrichment of their ideals of national life which
characterise the present time must render their self-consciousness a
far more efficient guide of all national deliberation and action.</p>

<p>The self-knowledge of the individual grows chiefly, as we have
seen, through intercourse with his fellows; his idea of himself develops
in fulness and accuracy in the light of his knowledge of other
selves, and this knowledge in turn develops in the light of his increasing
knowledge of himself. Just so the self-knowledge of nations
is now growing rapidly through the intercourse of each nation with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
others, an intercourse far freer, more multiplex, than ever before in
the history of the world; a result largely of the improved means of
communication which we owe to science and the spirit of inquiry.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking illustration of the operation of this
new factor is the rapid spread in recent years of parliamentary
institutions. The parliamentary system of national organisation was
worked out in these islands by long centuries of more or less blind
conflict of ideas and parties and institutions; and now other nations
in rapid succession have observed and admired the system and have
deliberately and self-consciously adopted it; and still the process
goes on, as recently in Russia.</p>

<p>Japan offers a striking illustration of the way in which the
new factor operates. An intelligent people in which the national
sentiment was strong, but in which national self-knowledge was
rudimentary because of the isolation of the nation, was suddenly
brought into contact with other peoples; through observation of
them, it learnt its own deficiencies and set about deliberately to
remedy them in the light of its new knowledge; and in doing so has
reorganised itself from top to bottom.</p>

<p>In England also national self-knowledge is beginning rapidly to
increase in accuracy and extent. We have begun to compare ourselves
at all points with other nations, and are no longer content
with the good old creed, that everything British is best. We are
learning in this way our weaknesses; and the knowledge is becoming
a main cause of accelerated progress. The best illustration is, perhaps,
the present stir over educational questions, which is directly due
to the increase of national self-knowledge resulting from the observation
of other nations.</p>

<p>But in the future our national self-consciousness will be enriched
and fitted for the guidance of the national will in a still more effective
manner than by the knowledge of our weaknesses being forced upon
us by the nations who are our rivals in the world. In many directions&mdash;by
the historians, the biologists, the anthropologists, the statisticians&mdash;data
are being gathered for a science of society whose sure indications
will enable us deliberately to guide the further evolution of the
nation towards the highest ideal of a nation that we can conceive.
In this way, it may be hoped, the modern nations will be able to
avoid that danger which has destroyed the great nations of the
past, and which has been the dark cloud shadowing the brilliance of
the age of progress that resulted from increasing human intercourse
and mutual understanding. In this way the free play of the spirit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of inquiry, which in all earlier ages has been highly dangerous to
the stability of nations and which, while it was the sole cause of
progress, nevertheless destroyed many of the nations whom it impelled
upon that path, will make for a greatly accelerated progress;
and, at the same time, it will enable us to secure, by deliberate
voluntary control, the bases of society, which in all previous ages
have rested solely upon custom, instinct, and the religious sanctions.</p>

<p>Not by any voluntary surrender of the reason, not by any
subjugation of the intellect to the dominion of obscure transcendental
ideas, such as is preached by Benjamin Kidd, Chatterton-Hill<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and
others who have realized the disintegrating effects of intellect on
earlier societies, but by a more strenuous use of our intellectual
faculties, and by a growth of knowledge, especially a knowledge of
the laws of human societies, will the stability and further evolution
of nations be maintained.</p>

<p>The nations whose progress will rest upon this basis will be in
a position very different from that of the older societies to which
the emancipation of the intellect was fatal. They fell for lack of
knowledge of natural laws, as soon as the progress of intellectual
inquiry had weakened their instinctive and customary bases. The
modern nations may reasonably hope that they are within sight of
knowledge which will enable them to avoid these dangers and to
continue their progress during an indefinitely long period. They
may even hope to progress, not only in respect of the intellectual
and moral tradition, but also in respect of racial qualities; for a
better knowledge of the factors at work and of the laws of heredity
will enable them to put an end to the influences now making for
race deterioration and to replace them by others of the opposite
tendency.</p>

<p>Such national progress will be truly teleological; it will be a
progress whose direction will be determined by the desire of an ideal
end present to the consciousness of all and striven after by the
collective deliberation and volition of the nation.</p>

<p>Thus the group spirit, rising above the level of a narrow patriotism
that regards with hostility all its rivals, recognising that only
through the further development of the collective life of nations can
man rise to higher levels than he has yet known, becomes the
supreme agent of human progress.</p>

through a crowd of five thousand warlike savages in the heart of Borneo. Representatives
of all the tribes of a large district of Sarawak had been brought
together by the resident magistrate for the purpose of strengthening friendly
relations and cementing peace between the various tribes. All went smoothly,
and the chiefs surrounded by their followers were gathered together in a large
hall, rudely constructed of timber, to make public protestations of friendship.
An air of peace and good-will pervaded the assembly, until a small piece of
wood fell from the roof upon the head of one of the leading chiefs, making a
slight wound from which the blood trickled. Only the immediate neighbours
of this chief observed the accident or could perceive its effect; nevertheless
in the space of a few seconds a wave of angry emotion swept over the whole
assembly, and a general and bloody fight would have at once commenced, but
that the Resident had insisted upon all weapons being left in the boats on the
river 200 yards away. The great majority of the crowd rushed headlong to
fetch their weapons from their boats, while the few who remained on the
ground danced in fury or rushed to and fro gesticulating wildly. Happily the
boats were widely scattered along the banks of the river, so that it was possible
for the Resident, by means of persuasion, threats, and a show of armed force,
to prevent the hostile parties coming together again with their weapons in hand.</p></div>

for the argument a surer basis of empirical data; and I have contended
that some at least of the cases of disintegration of personality are more easily
reconcilable with this view, than with the contrary doctrine which regards
the individual consciousness as the collective consciousness of the brain-cells.
See my <i>Body and Mind</i>, a book I found myself compelled to write in order
to arrive at a reasoned judgment on this difficult problem, which obtrudes
itself at the outset of the study of group life.</p></div>

and leaders of thought have expressed it hardly less strongly, though not all
of them have attached so much importance to the influence of the towns.
It has been expressed in general terms by Dr and Mrs Whetham (in the <i>Hibbert
Journal</i> for Oct. 1911), by Dean Inge in a number of forcible articles, by
Mr W. Bateson in his &#8216;Herbert Spencer Lecture&#8217; for 1912, and by other

those who have given any thought to the matter. A. R. Wallace argued
strongly in this sense; the late Benjamin Kidd set out the evidence impressively
in his <i>Social Evolution</i>, Chapter IX; and it is implied by all the many writers
who, as we have noted, agree in regarding the processes of selection in the
civilised nations as in the main reversed or detrimental.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> Shortly before his death Mr Kidd published (in the year 1918) his
<i>Science of Power</i>. In this book he showed a complete change of face on the
question of the importance of innate qualities. He denied all importance to
changes of innate qualities, whether for better or worse, because, as he maintained,
&#8220;the social heredity transmitted through social culture is infinitely
more important to a people than any heredity inborn in the individuals
thereof&#8221; (p. 273); and he made in this book a violent and scornful attack
upon the late Francis Galton and upon all who follow him in believing that the
decay or improvement of the racial qualities of a people are of importance
for its prosperity and development, and who, therefore, approve of Galton&#8217;s
effort to found a science of Eugenics. Kidd did not anywhere in his last book
acknowledge that he had made this very great change of principle, which
completely undermines the whole argument of his <i>Social Evolution</i>, but complacently
suggested that, as Newton and Darwin are regarded as the fathers
of modern physical and biological science respectively, so in the future Kidd
will be regarded as having founded anew in his <i>Social Evolution</i> the science
of society. On reading the <i>Science of Power</i> after having written this chapter,
I was amazed at this assumption on behalf of a book whose most fundamental
doctrine the author had himself renounced, and I turned again to the earlier
work to verify my brief summary of its argument. I confess that it is not
easy to make sure of what the author was driving at. But I find that Kidd,
in discussing the influence of religious systems, wrote (on p. 307) &#8220;Natural
selection seems, in short, to be steadily evolving in the race that type of
character upon which these forces act most readily and efficiently; that is to
say, it is evolving religious character in the first instance, and intellectual
character only as a secondary product in association with it.&#8221; On the following
page I find&mdash;&#8220;The race would, in fact, appear to be growing more and more
religious,&#8221; and &#8220;a preponderating element in the type of character which the
evolutionary forces at work in human society are slowly developing, would
appear to be the sense of reverence.&#8221; And there are many other passages
which, in spite of the habitual lack of precision of Kidd&#8217;s language, can only
be interpreted to mean that the improvement of moral or religious character,
on which he so strongly insists as a feature of recent centuries, involves and
depends upon improvement of innate qualities in the mass of the people.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_145_145" id="Footnote_145_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145_145"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> Otto Seeck (<i>op. cit.</i> vol. 1. p. 270) writes&mdash;&#8220;The equipment of the legionaries
remained unchanged from Augustus to Diocletian: no improvements of
tactics, no new munitions of war were brought into use during more than three
hundred years. The Roman saw his enemies becoming ever more terrible, his
own army ever less efficient; for now this, now that, Province was laid waste
and all were threatened. It was, therefore, to the most urgent interest of every
citizen that this state of affairs should be remedied; the most cultured circles
were familiar with the needs of the army, for all the higher officers came from
the class of Senators and nobles. Nevertheless, there appeared not a single invention,
which might have assured to the Roman soldiers their erstwhile
superiority! Books indeed were written upon tactics, strategy and fortification,
but their authors almost without exception were content to expound in a
formal manner what their more capable forefathers had taught; in this literature
the expression of any new idea was carefully avoided.... As in the
military sphere, so also was it in all others. Neither in agriculture, nor in
handicrafts, nor in the practice of statecraft, did a new idea of any importance
appear since the first century after Christ. Literature and art also moved only
in sterile imitation, which became always more poverty-stricken and technically
feebler.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The progress of Psychology during the last half century has been
both rapid and extensive. Along the lines of theoretical inquiry
significant and far-reaching results have been attained; the methods
of experimental research have been successfully applied to a wide
range of mental phenomena; and it is now generally recognised that
in connexion with the subject-matter of many branches of scientific
pursuit psychological problems of fundamental importance present
themselves for solution. The object of the <i>Cambridge Psychological
Library</i> is to furnish a series of books, written by men actually
engaged in the work of research, dealing with the various subjects
that come within the field of Psychology. The extent of this field
may be gauged from the titles of the volumes given below, some of
which have already appeared, the others being in preparation.</p>

<p>For the reasons indicated, the <i>Cambridge Psychological Library</i>
will appeal not only to Psychologists but also to students of many
other departments of scientific thought and investigation, such as
Philosophy, Sociology, Art, Comparative Religion, Anthropology,
Physiology, Zoology, Medicine, Education and Industrial Efficiency.</p>

<p>The following volumes have been arranged:</p>
